      "reply_content": "Hey Trader We appreciate you sharing your experience, but we must clarify the facts to provide the community with an accurate understanding. Our risk management rules, including loss limits, are clearly outlined in our Terms of Service and Help Center for every funded account, including instant-funded ones. These limits are in place to protect both the traders and the firm by ensuring responsible, sustainable trading. When an account reaches a loss threshold, even if there is an open profit on other trades, the net risk exposure is what determines compliance, not just individual open trades or profit alone. This is standard practice across legitimate prop firms and is designed to maintain fair trading conditions. Your account was managed according to these transparent rules, and any closure was the result of meeting those pre-set risk parameters. It is incorrect to label FundingTraders as a scam based on a clearly communicated risk policy that all traders agree to before funding. If you would like further clarification about how loss limits and account management work, please review our Terms of Service and Help Center. Our Risk Management Team is always available to assist with any questions or concerns. If you ever have questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to us at help@fundingtraders.com.

Our system continuously monitors accounts for compliance with the rule prohibiting copy trading or coordinated trading activity, including trades executed with the same IP address or highly similar entries and exits within short time frames, as outlined in our TOS. These measures protect the integrity of our evaluation and funding programs. When a suspected violation occurs, a thorough investigation is conducted that includes reviewing submitted evidence such as trading locations. If the evidence does not corroborate the user's claims or fails to refute coordinated trading concerns, actions including payout denial and account termination may be taken in full compliance. We uphold these standards to maintain a stable and consistent trading environment. We regret if communication during the investigation did not meet your expectations. Our Help Center and support team aim to provide clear explanations and timely responses. Blocking or banning accounts only occurs after careful review and due process, ensuring adherence to our policies. We encourage all users to review our Terms of Service and Risk Management guidelines carefully before and during participation in our programs, as acceptance of these terms is mandatory upon registration. Our commitment is to fairness, transparency, and the long-term success of our traders. If you ever have questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to us at help@fundingtraders.com.

      "content": "I recently took part in a $100K challenge with Fundingtraders.com. On July 3rd, I placed a SELL trade on EURUSD at 10:25 AM. As the trade moved in my favor, I adjusted my stop loss to lock in a 1:1 risk-reward ratio.However, during the trade, I experienced an unusually large spread spike, far beyond the typical range I’ve observed for EURUSD (usually around 1-5 points). But in this instance, the spread inexplicably exceeded 20 points which is about 2pips. My trade was closed as a result of this sudden spread widening, which was highly unexpected. Moments after I was stopped out, the spread returned to normal levels. The price then continued in the direction I had anticipated, which was frustrating to witness as it would have allowed me to pass the challenge.This experience has left me concerned about the trading conditions and overall reliability of this firm’s platform. I recommend anyone considering them to carefully review their terms and be cautious about sudden market behavior.",

      "reply_content": "Hey Trader, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. We understand how frustrating it can be to see a trade impacted by spread fluctuations, especially during a critical challenge phase. However, we’d like to provide some important context to help clarify the situation. Spread widening is a normal part of live market conditions and is not controlled or manipulated by our platform. Spreads can temporarily expand during periods of high volatility, economic news releases, or reduced liquidity, even on commonly traded pairs like EURUSD. These fluctuations are determined by our liquidity providers and are part of real market dynamics, not anomalies. Our platform uses institutional-grade pricing feeds, and all trades, including stop-loss triggers, are executed based on live bid/ask data received from those providers. While we understand it’s frustrating that the spread spike closed your trade prematurely, this was not the result of an error or malfunction, but a reflection of real market conditions that every trader is subject to. We encourage all traders to account for potential spread variations in their risk management strategies, particularly when setting tight stop losses. We remain committed to providing fair and realistic trading conditions, and we appreciate your feedback as we continue to improve the trader experience. If you ever have questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to us at help@fundingtraders.com. Regards, FundingTraders Team",

Labeling our firm a “scam” is not only false but disregards the thousands of traders who have successfully passed evaluations, received funding, and been paid out in full, all while operating within the clearly stated rules and guidelines outlined in our Terms of Service and Help Center. Our evaluation pricing is competitive to make access to capital more affordable, not to “trap” anyone. Every rule, from risk parameters to payout eligibility, is communicated up front. Traders who take the time to understand these rules typically have a smooth and successful journey. We welcome constructive feedback, but baseless accusations don’t reflect the integrity of the system we’ve built or the genuine success stories of traders who work within it.

Claims of bans without reason or ignored emails are not consistent with how we operate. We maintain active support channels and respond to all inquiries, though complex cases may require more time due to internal reviews. Regarding copy trading or trade mirroring, our system does not flag traders based solely on similar trades. Reviews are based on detailed server-side data, including trade timing, lot sizes, device usage, and IP behavior. With over a million traders globally, our detection tools are calibrated to identify patterns far beyond random overlap, we do not take action unless there's verifiable evidence of coordinated behavior. Discord bans only occur when users violate our community guidelines, including spreading false information or using abusive language. We always encourage traders to reach out through official channels for support or appeals, and we remain committed to maintaining a fair and transparent environment for all.

Your account was reviewed by our Risk Management Team after multiple trades showed clear patterns consistent with grid-style trading, a strategy that involves placing multiple positions in close proximity across correlated pairs or within short time intervals, which is strictly prohibited under our Terms of Service. These rules are in place to protect the sustainability of the funding model and are applied equally to all traders. The reduction in your payout was a direct result of these verified rule violations. You were not denied a payout, but rather issued a reduced payout in line with the severity of the breach, which is a discretionary but clearly communicated process. Thousands of traders receive full payouts by following the guidelines. We encourage every trader to understand the risk parameters and trading restrictions in advance.

Our payout process is clearly outlined in our Terms of Service and Help Center, and every trader agrees to these conditions before beginning their challenge or funded account. We do not withhold profits arbitrarily, all payouts are processed once the trader meets the outlined criteria and remains in compliance with our rules, which are fully transparent and publicly accessible. Your account was reviewed by our Risk Management Team after a flagged violation of trading behavior that directly breached the terms agreed upon. This was not a “hidden rule”, it was clearly stated and applied equally to all traders. When violations occur, payouts are placed on hold pending full investigation. If the breach is confirmed, the account is closed in accordance with the TOS. We do not pay out profits on accounts that violated core trading rules, as doing so would undermine the integrity of our program. The suggestion that we only pay small profits and block larger ones is false and unsupported, many traders have received substantial payouts, which are verifiable across multiple platforms and testimonials.

Our execution model has not changed, and there have been no modifications to the pricing engine or liquidity routing in the past week. All trades are executed through aggregated liquidity providers using institutional-grade pricing. Slippage, both positive and negative, is a natural part of trading, especially during volatile periods, news releases, or low-liquidity windows. Please note that execution prices are based on the real-time bid/ask spread at the moment of order fill. Chart printed data often reflects only the bid price and does not account for the spread, which can lead to perceived discrepancies between what you see on the chart and the actual fill price. This is a known and standard behavior across all trading platforms. We want to assure you that we do not and never have manipulated pricing or chart data. Our top priority is transparency, fairness, and the success of our traders. If you ever have questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to us at help@fundingtraders.com.

Problem: My chart data shows no candle reached 142.829 during that period (evidence attached).  This is unacceptable and requires investigation.Please:  1.  Explain this consistent adverse slippage.  2.  Provide the fill report (timestamp, liquidity source) for the USD/JPY trade @ 142.829.  3.  Confirm if your execution feed matches the chart feed.

      "reply_content": "Hey Trader, Thank you for bringing this to our attention. However, we’d like to clarify several important details to address the concerns you've raised. All trade executions on our platform are routed through liquidity providers using real-time market data feeds. Slippage, both positive and negative, is a normal part of trading during volatile or fast-moving market conditions. Claims of “consistent adverse slippage” are not supported by platform-wide data. In fact, many traders benefit from positive slippage under the same conditions. Our systems do not manipulate execution in favor of or against any trader. While your chart feed may not display a visible candle at that exact price, it’s important to understand that charts are often constructed using filtered or averaged pricing (typically bid prices), whereas executions depend on real-time tick-by-tick pricing, which can include bid, ask, and spread variations. This discrepancy is normal and expected across all professional platforms. To reiterate, there is no systematic issue with our execution engine, and all trades are processed fairly under real market conditions. If you ever have questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to us at help@fundingtraders.com. Regards, FundingTraders Team",

      "reply_content": "Hey Carlos, We appreciate you sharing your experience, but we must correct several key inaccuracies for the sake of transparency and fairness. Our Next Gen accounts follow clearly defined rules, all of which are publicly available in our Terms of Service and Help Center. While the Next Gen program offers flexibility and faster payouts, all accounts, regardless of type, are still subject to core risk management protocols designed to ensure sustainable and responsible trading. Your account was flagged for violating risk parameters that are explicitly covered under our platform-wide guidelines. While you may not have seen a standalone 2% rule listed for Next Gen accounts, our Risk Management Team reserves the right to review trades that show excessive exposure or high-risk behavior inconsistent with professional standards. This is outlined clearly in the TOS you agreed to at purchase. As for the claim that we only showcase small payouts or support-focused reviews, that is simply not true. We have funded and paid out well beyond $3K to thousands of traders globally, many of whom have shared their journey publicly. We also prioritize customer support, which is why so many traders highlight their positive experiences with our team. Account suspensions are never taken lightly and are only executed when there is a clear and documented breach. We are fully transparent and encourage all traders to read and understand the rules before trading. If you ever have questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to us at help@fundingtraders.com. Regards, FundingTraders Team",

Our support and risk management teams carefully investigate every case and respond to all inquiries based on the facts presented and in alignment with our Terms of Service. Claims that \"nobody cares\" are simply not true, our support records show responses were provided along with clear explanations referencing your account activity. Screenshots alone do not always represent the full context of trading activity. Our Risk Management Team reviews all data directly from our server logs to ensure complete accuracy and fairness. If a violation of the rules occurs, such as breaching drawdown limits or other risk parameters, the system flags it automatically, and decisions are made strictly according to the rules every trader agrees to before beginning the challenge. Our goal is not to profit from challenge fees but to build long-term partnerships with consistent and disciplined traders. Thousands of traders are funded and paid out through our platform, and we stand by our track record of transparency and compliance. We encourage all traders to familiarize themselves with our Help Center and Terms of Service, which outline every aspect of our process in detail. If you believe an error occurred, we always welcome a professional dialogue, but unfounded accusations and emotionally charged statements do not reflect the reality of how we operate. If you ever have questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to us at help@fundingtraders.com. Regards, FundingTraders Team",

E8 and the 5ers, I got paid properly and no BS rules with so much nonsense, consistent score rule to fail traders.Don't trust their CEO Stan and avoid his you tube channel, I was naived and stupid whatever he try to self promote to lure people into his firm.  Go to youtube channel of this company Fundingtraders and read the comments, it will show so much fraud this prop firm did with no payment to traders.I regret I did not research this prop firm carefully.search this propfirm on youtube and read the comments to avoid wasting your moneysearch with this title it will show upThe Truth About Prop Firms - This is how you WIN",

      "reply_content": "Hey Trader, We take feedback seriously, but we strongly disagree with the claims made in this review. Our operations follow clear and transparent procedures, which are publicly available in our Terms of Service and Help Center. Promotions and payouts are conducted in strict accordance with our rules, and all participants are held to the same consistent standards, there is no manipulation or intent to cause traders to fail. Regarding payouts, our default processing time is 24-48 business hours. In some cases, due to compliance or account verification reviews by our Risk Management Team, processing may take slightly longer. These steps are in place to ensure trader and platform integrity. The claims of “BS rules” and “scoring systems to fail traders” are inaccurate and misleading. Our consistency score is a risk management measure that helps traders build disciplined habits and long-term sustainability. We encourage anyone reading this to do their own research, read our Terms of Service, and view our verified trader testimonials. Thousands of traders have successfully received payouts through our platform. We also respect the work of other prop firms like E8 and The 5ers, but misleading comparisons and defamatory statements do not reflect the full picture. For accurate information, we urge you to reach out to our support team or consult our official resources (help@fundingtraders.com) Regards, FundingTraders Team",

Your account was not downgraded or banned without justification. Our risk team identified a trading pattern consistent with the use of an unauthorized Expert Advisor (EA), which is a direct violation of our terms, particularly when the source or logic of the EA cannot be verified. While we do not require a stop loss on every trade, we do require that traders demonstrate responsible risk management, whether manual or automated. When asked to provide evidence clarifying your trading method, the materials submitted did not sufficiently explain the automated behavior observed on the account. As a result, and in line with our policies, your account was closed. We take these matters seriously and maintain strict standards to ensure a fair environment for all traders. We remain fully committed to paying out compliant traders and continue to do so every single day.

The problem came when the amount was larger.In this case, the withdrawal ( i can attach screenshots, all is documented ) was for $7,362 and was requested on May 20th. They claim to pay within 24–48 hours.What happened? They haven’t paid. It’s that simple.I’ve followed all the rules they require. I haven’t broken a single one. I have everything documented and recorded (I will soon add a link to a video on a well-known trader's YouTube channel sharing my experience — stay tuned).Their only reply is that they are very busy handling other requests and that they’ll get back to me soon… Time goes by, and I keep receiving the same responses. No one takes responsibility. It’s a shame that companies like this end up scamming those who trusted them. I’ve lost $7,300, which took me a lot of effort and dedication to earn. I truly hope my experience helps you avoid buying anything from this company. Today it was me — tomorrow it could be you.Best regards.Updated: 7 weeks “checking” my account? Strange. I re-confirm my opinion. STAY FAR FROM THIS COMPANY, next time they unpayed can be you.",

Your payout request is not being ignored, nor is there any attempt to avoid payment. Our records show that your case is currently under review due to account activity that raised internal compliance flags, a standard part of our security and verification process, especially for higher payout amounts. This review is not punitive, but procedural, and ensures that all payouts are issued to traders who remain fully within our terms. We understand the frustration around delays and are actively working to finalize your case. While we strive to process all payouts within 24–48 hours, complex reviews may take longer, and we communicate that transparently. We have a consistent history of paying out traders who meet the guidelines, including many larger withdrawals, and we stand by our integrity. Regards, FundingTraders Team",

Our rules do not change after funding, they are clearly outlined from the start and remain consistent throughout all phases.

Regarding your payout claim, our records show a violation of the daily or overall loss limit, which is automatically tracked by the system, this is not a manual decision nor subject to interpretation. We are a firm that pays out consistently, with thousands of successful payouts completed. We strongly encourage traders to fully review the terms before participating and to reach out to our support team if there is any confusion (help@fundingtraders.com). Regards, FundingTraders Team",

Our trading platform operates with real market conditions, including spread fluctuations and occasional slippage, both of which are standard across all brokers, especially during periods of low liquidity or high volatility. In this particular case, the trade was closed in accordance with live market pricing and spread behavior at the time. The platform did not force-close your trade arbitrarily, and our team thoroughly reviewed the pricing data before responding. As noted in our TOS, managing risk, including understanding the impact of spreads, is ultimately the trader's responsibility.

They are low. And here is where the good things end.Without going into ridiculous details, this prop firm is doing EVERYTHING they possibly can to avoid paying their traders, having numbers of hidden rules and making new ones on the go just to deny payout and terminate funded accounts even if you won’t breach any official rules. I have made over 20% of 50k account in a month and a half time. Got nothing out of that. All refused. They said they have no consistency rule - that’s a lie they have consistency score which is even worse, they said they have no risk per trade - another lie, if you risk more 2% on your trade they will fail your account and refuse a payout.And of course they will BAN you form discord chats when you start asking questions and you expose their actions. At the moment I’m facing 7 days ban for asking about payout denied. To get any answer or clarification you have to wait 3/4 days sometimes even more for one email or message. It’s not worth your money, your time, and your efforts to sing up with this company.Avoid at all costs.",

      "reply_content": "Hey Trader, We appreciate your feedback, though it’s important to correct several misleading claims to help the community understand the facts. First, we do not have a hidden consistency rule. Our platform offers flexibility in trading style, and traders are free to express their edge, as long as their risk remains responsible and within the clearly stated guidelines available in our Help Center. The “consistency score” mentioned is a tool, not a rule, and it does not disqualify payouts. We do not terminate funded accounts without cause. If an account is denied a payout, it is always based on violations of transparent and documented terms. Our goal is to support and scale serious traders, not to penalize success. Lastly, we only issue temporary Discord timeouts when community guidelines are violated, such as spreading false information, using aggressive language, or attempting to disrupt trader support. Everyone is welcome to ask questions and engage respectfully. We remain committed to fairness and transparency, and thousands of traders are actively funded and paid with us every week. We encourage anyone reading this to visit our Help Center, check our payouts channel, or speak with real traders in our community.

Firstly, our commissions and spreads remain consistent between the evaluation and funded phases. We do not increase costs after passing, this is a common misconception, and we encourage traders to review their trading conditions in detail at each stage. Many of our traders, including scalpers and indices traders, perform successfully under the same conditions. Secondly, our drawdown calculations are entirely automated and based on clearly defined metrics, which are transparently outlined in our Help Center. If your account breached due to drawdown, it would have aligned precisely with the agreed-upon risk parameters. We’ve found no technical issues with the systems calculating drawdown. We understand that trading can be emotional, especially after an account breach, but it’s important to stick to the facts. Our platform is built on fairness, consistency, and transparency and thousands of traders succeed with us every day.

We’d like to clarify that we do not withhold payouts from traders who follow the clearly outlined rules and risk parameters in our Terms of Service. Our systems flag accounts only when specific violations occur, such as high-risk trading patterns, reverse trading tactics, or other prohibited strategies, regardless of the percentage risk declared by the trader. All payout requests are reviewed manually to ensure compliance, and only those that fall outside the permitted guidelines are rejected. We take these situations seriously and provide traders with details when a payout is denied. Additionally, we do not pay for reviews. Our 5-star ratings come from real traders who appreciate the fast support and structured environment we offer.

In fact, my equity had only moved slightly below the starting point, staying well within all defined risk parameters.I had made about $500+ in profit today, and no open trades had unrealized losses exceeding acceptable limits.Given these figures, I kindly request a thorough review of the reason behind the restriction. If this was an error in the system or an internal flagging mechanism, I would appreciate it if you could reinstate my trading privileges or clarify what specific rule or data triggered the violation.I look forward to your prompt response and resolution.Warm regards,Offor EmekaAccount ID: 21807",

      "content": "If I could issue a zero I would. I used them for the first time today and they closed my account down for \"Failed due to Maximum Risk Limit Exceeded\" to which I immedialy responded back to as I initially tried to close my trade down at a small loss at 14:00 and hour prior to the high impact news event. I was unable to do this as my MT5 was greyed out from making any changes. I was able to tighten my stops with The5ers and Traderscale which both worked fine within MT5. It was just this one. So I allowed the trade to run on at a 1% risk. The trade went on to reach my target and following this I immediately had an email advising the account was breached. When I tried to question this they tried to blame my broadband connection. Use them at your own risk. Lucky enough I used my CC and will be logging a claimback. Further update:My account didn't exceed the risk limit due to my SL which wasn't hit. This was confirmed by your advisor via email. His explanation was that it was due to slippage. However, was unable to explain why the SL wasn't hit which was within the risk parameters if it was slippage. The trade went on to profit and then you closed the account. I advised that I will be contacting my credit card provider and then was threatened by their advisor begging me not to do this because if I do. They will block me from their platform and all their affiliate partners. Stay well clear of of company. I have the full version of events via email and happy to publish them on here. Email response:Hi Kevin,Thanks for your follow-up.Your account breached the 1% max risk per trade rule on the Instant Funded program. Even if your SL was placed at 1%, the actual loss slightly exceeded the limit, and as per our policy, any amount over triggers an automatic failure.There was no system downtime at the time — the platform was fully operational.We appreciate your passion, but we kindly remind you that initiating a chargeback would constitute a breach of our Terms of Service and result in a permanent ban from our platform so please refrain from thatShould you wish to return in the future, we’d be happy to have you back with a fresh account and a tighter risk plan.Best regards,ObiwanFundingTradersQuestion: if this was due to slippage and I breached the risk parameters even knowing my SL was within the risk parameters the SL would have been hit. Given it wasn't hit means I didn't breach the risk parameters.",

Your account was closed due to a breach of the Maximum Risk Limit. This rule is in place to ensure fair and consistent trading conditions for all participants. Your claim about being unable to close the trade due to a platform issue was not supported by any system errors on our side. Our trading servers were fully operational during that time, and we had no downtime affecting executions or trade modifications. The issue you described appears to be isolated and unrelated to our platform, as confirmed by internal technical checks. Many traders across our platform operate MT5 without issue. While we cannot comment on other firms, we can confirm that risk violations on our side are strictly based on data and not decided manually or arbitrarily. We welcome traders who follow the rules and trade with discipline, and we are always available to clarify any policy before you begin trading.

Repeatedly following up, but it's just delaying delaying and then have escalated to concerned team, escalated sorry for delay - but I missed the market opportunity!!!I got 1 spike but really I missed nearly 2700 profit, your system stopped me after I was in profit.However, at least you people should have courtesy to restore my account. ON June 9, the Ger 40 was 2700+ in profit when account closed due to spike and drawdown (Screenshot attached) , if I had those positions open till now, then I would have got more than 10k profits!!????.Really it's total loss for me, missed huge profits 😭😭😭😭Really pissed off!!!!!!!! Due to your ignoranceHowever, as the team mentioned, you’re eligible for a retake for 19975.What is meant by retake????, pls clarify and make it in simple words.Pls connect me to Khalifa,Or you mean to say that I need purchase the plan once again??????? You people are cheating people, if 3% is hard breach then you should specify on the main page, why hide it somewhere else. I need my refund, then why Khalifa told my account will be resetted in 11 Hours on 9 June. Again max loss per day is 3% and if account get terminated on 1st isbtant then why the 6% trailing drawdown is provided.If you are kicking out people on 3%, then what's the use of 6%, no person can reach upto 6% loss!!!!!!This is pure cheating!!!!!No issues I will take it to Trust pilot, you are cheating people.Simple question if u stop people at 3% loss then no person can reach upto 6% loss, then what's the purpose of this 6% maximum trialing loss???????????Answer me???? +Why looting and cheating peopleY fake promises?????On 9th June 2025, Khalifa wrote2:15 pmKKhalifa • 4d agoIt’s not a full terminationYour account will be reset after 11hrs.

      "reply_content": "Hey Trader, We’re sorry to hear about your frustration, but your description of events is not consistent with our records or policies. Your account experienced a hard breach of the daily loss limit, which, as clearly stated in the rules for our latest Instant Funding accounts, results in an automatic termination. This information is transparently available on our website and in our Help Center. The confusion seems to stem from a misunderstanding between older and newer account structures, something we have since clarified directly with you. At no point was there a system failure or error in risk management. Our system did exactly what it is programmed to do: protect capital when a predefined limit is exceeded. The claim that a potential profit was “missed” is based on hindsight, the platform does not assess trades based on what could have happened if rules were ignored. We did, however, offer you a retake at no additional cost as a gesture of goodwill, despite the breach being valid. We remain open to resolving this with you professionally, but we encourage all traders to take a moment to understand the clear guidelines in place before trading. We support disciplined traders who take time to review and follow the rules, and we continue to maintain transparency and fairness across all accounts.

Maybe your policy is different.I was mentioned that you will receive the payout in the mail between 24 to 48 hours.And in my case it had been more than a week. Whenever I message on helpdesk or on discord the only reply I get is that the team is working on it.Then I breached my account by taking high leverage.

We strive to provide timely support both on Discord and through the help desk, but response times can vary depending on volume. We encourage respectful communication in all channels to ensure continuous assistance, and bans on Discord occur only in cases of repeated violation of community guidelines, not for raising legitimate concerns.

      "reply_content": "Hey Adnan, We appreciate your feedback, but your description does not align with the account data we maintain for every trader. Our systems track all equity fluctuations in real-time, and accounts are only breached if the clearly defined daily loss limit is hit based on real-time equity drawdown, not just closed trades. In your case, be reminded that the daily loss limit for 1-step accounts is relative to starting day's equity. The equity was up so high that when the daily drawdown was reset, the daily limit went up above the balance, which caused the account to be marked as \"Failed\". We understand the frustration, but we encourage all traders to fully understand the rules before trading. Our goal is to support consistent and disciplined traders, and we remain transparent and fair in all evaluations.

      "content": "Stay away! They are scammers! I bought a challenge of 200k and successfully completed it, upon review they decided to halve my account saying that I am a high risk trader even though I followed all their rules, I got a payout of 500$ + a refund, on my second payout of 8k, they told me that my profit had more than 50% of news profit, so they asked me to place 10 trades of + or - 0.5%, during those trades, I had completed around 7 trades before they close the account again and once again they asked me to place another 10 trades, essentially they wanted me to overtrade and lose my profits, I completed those trades and increased my profits to 12k, upon review they accused me of news trading once again and a red GBP folder when I am trading gold, GBP news doesnt have a big impact on gold and usd pairs. So they decided to terminate my account and still had to pay me 50% of my profits, after 1 month of waiting they sent the payout, but they sent it to the wrong address, an address I have never seen before and they told me that it was the address I provided them, I tried to resolve this but they said it was my fault. I just decided to leave everything behind and forget about it since there was nothing I could do. Very bad prop firm, one of the worst.",

Your account was reviewed according to our clearly stated guidelines, and at no point were you asked to \"overtrade\" or violate any trading principles.

As for the payout, our records confirm the wallet address matched the one provided on your payout request. We always recommend double-checking payout details to avoid issues, and we processed your payout despite rule breaches as a gesture of goodwill.

      "content": "I would highly recommend anyone to stay far away from Funding Traders. After spending a few months to pass both phases of the challenge they disallowed my funded account, as they accused me of using a martingale strategy. I do not trade using a martingale strategy and anyone who actually would take a look at my trades could clearly see that. The issue was that there were a few trades where second positions were opened, which were opened inadvertently on the Trade Locker mobile app. There is an issue with the Trade Locker mobile app where the buy and sell buttons are at the right and left side at the bottom. If you are not careful your hand could accidently brush against one of these buttons which will open a trade. When this happened to me I would delete the second position as soon as I noticed it open. They viewed these few instances as me using a martingale strategy and disallowed my funded account. Once explaining to them how those second positions happened they wrote me back stating that the funded account is disallowed, and that they will not consider the possible reason for any inadvertent trades caused by a flaw in their app. Their communication with me was very brusk and they obviously were not interested in seeing what is an obvious problem. I believe that they look for any reason to disqualify anyone who may pass their challenges. If for some reason Funding Traders decided to respond to this review keep in mind that in my communication with them, they were only interested in disqualifying me and had no intention in discussing what is an obvious problem with Trade Locker mobile app. Trading is hard enough without you in the end getting disqualified for a slip of a finger or a problem with an app. Do you really want to invest your money and time into this prop firm only to have to deal with a risk management team that has no interest in talking with you and instead send brusk emails. Obviously they could handle their communications with their customers much better, but I think they could really care less.In response to Funding Traders: Funding Traders are obviously just sending a canned message and avoiding the issue I mentioned in the original review. I do not use martingale strategy in any of my trades, it is not a trading strategy that I use. I would accept Funding Traders explanation if in fact I were actually trading using a martingale strategy. I explained the reason an additional position opened up on the one trade of hundreds they are making an issue about. It is a problem with the TradeLocker mobile app. The buy and sell buttons are too close to the bottom of the screen where many people hold their phones. In my case that additional position was opened when my hand unintentionally brushed against the buy/sell button and it opened the second position. Funding Traders besides inadequately responding to my review and address the actual issue, they obviously were in a hurry to send out any kind of a response in a weak effort to defend themselves, showing how little they care for their customers.",

Bad market conditions and excessive spreads even though when you purchase the account, they tell you low spreads. This is very disappointing. I had a winning position, mind you the position never got near the SL, I get into meta trader, and the positon was closed at 50 pips above my entry price.

      "content": "Don't waste your time or money with this fraud of a company. They look for ways to ensure you fail. I passed 4 25K accounts phase 1 & 2. I was then accused of trade copying, which was a lie. All the accounts had the same positions that I manually put on. They were JPY pair swing shorts that I held for weeks. The 4th account had moved away a bit before I could put the positions on so since the entry prices were a bit different, they accused me of news trading to fail that account. Absolutely ridiculous, but I guess they felt bad for this level of corruption so they actually refunded me on that account. When these prop firms began, you had 5% daily drawdown and 10% total. Now every rule in the book is created to breach traders. In my case I didn't breach anything, but they saw a trader that could trade and realized they didn't want to deal with having to pay out a successful trader. Take heed of all these negative reviews and save your money. Also, no need in trying to dispute anything, they won't respond. This firm will be out of business soon.Account numbers that they screwed me on: 8561, 8563, 8560, 8568If you are foolish enough to buy a challenge, make sure you claw back your money from your credit card company when they screw you. Trust me, they will!",

      "content": "Mixed experience on Funding Traders. On one hand, excellent customer support (Magnesium, Khalifa, Kid, Saint) with very quick assistance, they answer my questions very well and the support is perfect. The trading conditions (on Daichalconic MT5) are also perfect, good spreads, fast execution. The account validation between phase 1 and phase 2 and between phase 2 and the funded phase is also perfect (i validate 25k 2 phases Next Gen and 50k 2 phases Next Gen). On the other hand, paying is a different story. Payment 'Reviewed', but never arrived in my cryptocurrency account. And I have been waiting for more than 48 hours working day (reference 1768 for the payout). It's a shame because it's an excellent prop firm, but without effective payment, I can't give more than 3 stars. If I get paid, I will update the stars to give more stars and update the comment on the payment. Thank you for all, and I hope the payout will arrive one day in my crypto wallet and that future payments don't take more than 48 hours to arrive. Thank you. YannisPS : on the 20 may 2025 12h01 (french hour GMT+2) i have not be paid by Funding Traders. So i consider that they don't want to pay me even if i made a benefict and i respect all the rules, all excuses to don't pay (must wait, etc etc). I know the scam of My Forex Funds, i know the scam of True Forex Funds, now i know the scam of Funding Traders. Even if the platform is good and the support excellent, as you don't pay trader i have not another solution than to alert all traders about your process to don't pay the beneficts. When my reference 1768 will be paid in my crypto wallet i will update the comment (comment updating not before but after paying that benefict in my crypto wallet the 648,54$ i have make and i request on the 14 may 2025 15h27).

When I requested a withdrawal, the company asked me to sign up for a Rise WorkPay account for payouts. I complied, but the KYC/KYB process on Rise's side caused significant delays that were completely out of my control. No alternative withdrawal methods were offered.3. On April 5, I received an email stating that my account was “failed” due to 21 days of inactivity—despite the fact that:This rule was never disclosed to me when I signed up or during my trading.I received no email notification or warning before this sudden termination.My profits were made well before March 14, long before the alleged inactivity period.4. I requested either reinstatement of my account or a payout of my share (80% = $15,200). Both were denied. They refused to return my profits or even give access to my account again.In short: I did everything right, earned nearly $20,000 through honest trading, and they shut me down without warning, using a hidden rule and delay from their payment processor as an excuse. I did not receive a single dollar of my profit.How Can I Get Money from this prop firm\"Funding Traders\"?",

I stayed within the 2 minute window, didn't do trading news, and I'm a scalper but I made sure I followed all the rules and they wrote am email threatening my account saying they don't see my style of trading to be successful in the long run. How can you judge that based on me passing the challenges in 1 day and I wouldn't have had as much profit if I didn't have to hold a trade for 2 minutes. They're trying to find every excuse to take my account plus muted me for 7 days because I called them out in their discord. STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!Update: I didn't do or say anything wrong in the chat, I was asking questions and responding to those asking about consistency rule and saying there's a consistency score which is almost the same thing. Yall didn't tell me, I inboxed all of the admins, and no one told me why I was blocked and for 7 days at that. Very unprofessional to not even tell people why you're blocking them but again it's because you want to mislead in peace and I see that. Again I followed all the rules but because YALL can't see how I trade because it's only been 2 days and I passed both phases, you threaten me when yall have no idea how I trade nor if it's longevity or not but threaten my account so YES you make up rules and use perception to take away accounts.",

I was about to receive the third payout with this 50k account, but it got denied with the reason of trading GER30 while GBP news (come on guys)Even their Trustpilot score is manipulated. Every single 5 star review contains shoutouts (including their name) to one of their (horribly unhelpful) support guys. In my opinion very suspicious (dont see this pattern among other prop firms)And now watch Funding Traders reply to this review, stating that I am telling lies and that they operate with complete transparency bla bla bla... please dont fall for those crooks.",

      "content": "Passed the challenge – all three $100K accounts failed at once due to Martingale rule under strictest conditionsI took the $100K 1-step challenge with Funded Traders and successfully passed three separate accounts. Without warning, all three were failed at once, with the explanation that I violated the Martingale rule.I did not use a classic Martingale strategy. My position sizing was based on risk management and market structure — not doubling down on losses. I met all profit and drawdown criteria, and still, my progress was instantly denied across all accounts.This happened under the 1-step challenge, which is already known for having much stricter rules and tighter limits than standard programs. And to make things worse, Funded Traders later removed the Martingale rule entirely for new (NextGen) accounts — but gave no option for Legacy users like me to transition, appeal, or receive a fair review.When I contacted support to explain the situation, the responses I received were cold, robotic, and completely unhelpful — as if the staff were forced to be there. No empathy, no willingness to reconsider, no flexibility.This isn't just a complaint — I have full records and proof of everything. I'm prepared to show detailed evidence of my trades and compliance with the rules, because claims like this are serious, and they deserve transparency.Conclusion: I cannot recommend Funded Traders to any serious trader.They apply outdated rules inconsistently, fail multiple accounts without proper justification, and offer zero support when questioned. A truly disappointing experience.",

While we understand your frustration, we must respectfully clarify that your accounts were reviewed thoroughly and action was taken in full accordance with the rules you agreed to upon registration. The Martingale-like trading pattern observed was not based on assumptions, but on objective risk behavior across your positions that posed a clear violation of our risk protocols. The rule was not applied retroactively, and your trades were not disqualified without cause. Although our programs evolve over time, all participants are held to the terms active at the time of their challenge. We remain committed to fair, transparent, and consistent evaluation of all accounts and encourage traders to always review the rules in detail to avoid misunderstandings.

The \"2% Trade Idea\":  This means in any time if you loose 2% at the same time you FAILED.2. The Two (2) Minute Rule:  This means if in the same direction if you closed and opened the other in less than 2 minutes, you FAILED.  3. Recentlly they added Martingale restriction without telling any one.  This means you are NEVER allowed to have a larger size postion than the privious one in one direction.Think for yourself. would you be able to succeed ans last long with this firm ??? I don't think so. My advice to any one WHO thinks of join this one, PLEASE DON'T !",

      "title": "Company confirmed my $20,909 payout, 10days later reversed it with false excuses",
      "content": "I am writing this updated review after reading the company’s reply to my previous post regarding my unpaid confirmed payout from Funding Traders. I strongly deny their claims, and I kindly ask Trustpilot to only publish this message after verifying my evidence, which I am ready to submit in full. Since attachments are not allowed here, I ask readers to note: this message reflects facts supported by documented proof, and the review is only public because Trustpilot confirmed the credibility of my claims.📍1. About the 12-Day Silence and CommunicationI strongly dispute the company’s claim of professional and timely communication. Over the 12 days following the confirmed payout, they responded only a few times. I have screenshots of all emails and timestamps, clearly showing days of silence and vague responses like “please wait.” On May 6, I suddenly received a message that my payout receipt was incorrect — 10 days after it had been officially issued.📍2. Retroactive Rule Change and $5,000 DeductionOriginally, the company tried to deny my payout completely due to a new rule introduced a week after I had already started trading in the funded account (not evaluation). Later, they changed their stance and offered only 30% of my profits. I pushed back by sending a screenshot of their rules from the date I joined, and they then admitted that I was right. After this, we agreed that $5,000 would be deducted, and the remaining $20,616.38 would be paid.The difference between their original offer (30%) and our final agreement (80%) proves they accepted that the rule was indeed new. I have full email documentation of this.📍3. EA Accusation After Confirmed PayoutThe most serious issue: on April 25, my payout was confirmed in writing. But on May 6 — after more than a week of no payment — I received a message accusing me of using an Expert Advisor (EA). I strongly deny this. I do not use EAs, I don't even know how. All trades were placed manually. The accusation was made after the confirmed payout, without any detailed explanation or evidence.How can a firm issue a finalized payout receipt, promise payment “within 24 hours,” and then cancel it 12 days later with a vague accusation? What’s the point of formal confirmation if it can be revoked at will?📍4. Being Silenced and BlockedTheir CEO personally removed me from their Telegram group after I politely asked about my pending payment. I have screenshots showing my message and the moment I was removed. I was then blocked by the CEO on Telegram and have since never received a response to my emails to him — not even once.📍5. Final StatementI completely reject the company's claims made in their public response. I am a serious trader who worked hard for this profit, not a novice gambler. I have no reason to lie. I have provided Trustpilot with full supporting evidence to verify everything in this review.I ask the Trustpilot team to continue to hold this company accountable, and I warn other traders: do not trust payout confirmations unless you actually receive the money. My experience shows how this firm failed to honor their own promises and responded with false excuses when I demanded what I was owed.",

I understood one thing and acted on it as it is written, while it meant something different and I advised that the wording of the regulation could be changed so that it is crystal clear.I explained my point of view to the risk management department and they explained theirs. We had a good speedy conversation. At the end, as a sign of goodwill, they reinstated my purchased challenge account and wished me luck. If more companies acted this way, the world will be a better place. Their brand image just rose a thousand fold in my eyes.I will be updating this review regularly once I become a funded trader.",

They funded me quickly and always very responsive. I have to admit, in the beginning I went through multiple failed accounts \"which was all my fault\", but I continued to buy more challenges. I would have never purchased as many challenges as I did, if they were not a great company. Trading requires a lot of mental and emotional control, along with a lot of studying and taking this as a career.  If you put in the work, and stick by the rules, then you will be fine. I 100% recomend Funding Traders and look forward to a bright future as well as contributing wherever I can. Always be thankful for opportunities like these. 💖",

      "content": "My experience with FundingTraders was extremely bad, stay away from this prop firm. They are stealing your money.From the start, there was a lack of transparency in their operations. The rules seemed to shift without notice, evaluation criteria were vague and inconsistently applied, and their customer support doesn't exist and it takes days to have an answer that doesn't solve any problem. Than another 4/5 days after that to receive another answer that doesn't solve the problem. The real issues began when I reached the funded account. At first I passed a 200k phase but they just gave me a 100k phase. And they told me to accept the 100k funded or the only alternative was to be refunded. If I wanted the 200k I should have reached a 10% profit (spoiler: even if I then reached the 10% profit they have never given me the 200k account) I was able to make a 3.5% payout on the 100k account with a 1% risk per trade. And they denied me the payout for news trading (they changed the news trading rule the day before without warning any trader, and I didn't notice that). So they told me that the news trading profit couldn't be more of the 50% of the total payout. So I continued trading and reached a profit of the 7.5% on the account. So now the news trading profits were less of the 50% of the requested payout. And now as you can imagine, they denied my payout telling me I traded during a news. When in the hours I made the trades there were no medium or high impact news (yes because they consider also medium impact news and not only high impact ones). So tried to reach the support and after waiting for 3 weeks for a check of my trades, and after I gave them all the proves needed that attested that I didn't open/closed trades ot tp/sl hitted during the window time stated on their rules, they just confirmed the denial of the payout without any reason or evidence to support their point of view.So I was faced with unjustified accusations of rule violations, suspicious account terminations, and a clear unwillingness to cooperate or provide fair treatment. I then understood they were doing everything possible to avoid paying.I’ve worked with other prop firms and know what to expect from a legitimate and professional company. FundingTraders is not one of them.Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. There are far better and more trustworthy options available. PS: A lot of their reviews are fake, in trustpilot but also on sites like propfirmmatch. And unfortunately even those who work inside know that they don't pay. And if you try to ask for help on discord exposing the firm. They will ban you immediately. Trying to cover it all up.  Solid firms don't offer 50% discount on mostly every month.Avoid them. I have warned you.",

      "reply_content": "Hey Giammarco, We appreciate your feedback, but we must respectfully clarify several inaccuracies presented in your statement. FundingTraders maintains a transparent and structured framework for all traders, with rules and terms clearly outlined and accessible prior to account purchase. These rules are not arbitrarily changed or applied inconsistently, and all updates are communicated through official channels. Your funded account was issued in alignment with the criteria met during your evaluation, and the option to upgrade or receive a refund was provided as a gesture of flexibility. Regarding the payout process, we uphold strict compliance with our risk management guidelines, including rules around news trading. These policies exist to ensure fair trading conditions across the board and are not subject to sudden or unnotified changes. The review process of your trades was conducted thoroughly and in line with our standards. The denial of your payout was not arbitrary, but based on verifiable breaches of the outlined rules. We regret that the outcome did not align with your expectations, but we are committed to fairness and consistency in all trader evaluations. Any implication that our reviews are fabricated or that support is deliberately unhelpful is categorically false. We have a dedicated team that actively addresses all inquiries, and disciplinary actions on community platforms are only taken when terms of service or community guidelines are violated. We stand by our integrity, and while not every trader may agree with every outcome, our goal remains to provide a reliable and performance-based opportunity for serious traders.",

      "title": "Next Gen Account Broken",
      "content": "I want to share my negative experience with them, specifically with their Next Gen Funded account program. On the surface, their offer seems appealing, but in practice, the rules they aplied are poorly designed and very unfairly enforced. In my case, I had a $25,000 Next Gen account, i had a bad trading day and lost $1,400. The next day, I was able to recover the loss and made a $200 in profit. However, they say that my consistency score is 247% because of the day in wich I recovered everything and made only 200 in profits now the balance being $25,200.So, the issue is this, they calculate the consistency score based on your gross profits for the day, regardless of whether that profit is simply recovering prior losses or actual net gains beyond break-even. This logic is unfair, because you can only withdraw if you're beyound brake-even in my case $25,000.Instead of rewarding solid, disciplined recovery, they punish you for recovering your loses, even if that day only brings you back to where you started in breke-even, in my case 25k.From my point of view, the consistency rule should only apply to real net profits.What i mean is, gains that are made to recover previous losses should NOT penalize a trader in the consistency score basis, for recovering from a losing day. IS NOT REASONALBE TO DO SO.For me they didn't provide a fair or transparent environment for trader in their Next Gen, because they didn't tell you that this works like that, for all of the traders it's common sense that only the profits of the account count for the consistency score. Poorly designed next gen rules, and appling rules like this only shows the lack of compsasion for traders that this busnes has.I'm willing to remove this bad review if they change the consistency rule.",

      "reply_content": "Hey Eric, Thank you for sharing your feedback. However, your interpretation of the consistency rule within the Next Gen Funded program does not align with how the rule is defined or communicated. The consistency score is transparently calculated based on daily gross profits to ensure that traders demonstrate controlled and repeatable performance over time, not one-off recoveries that expose accounts to excessive intra-day volatility. The purpose of this rule is not to penalize traders for recovering losses, but rather to reward stable and strategic trading. Every trader agrees to these terms before beginning the program, and they are available for review at any time on our platform. Recovery after a drawdown that results in an unusually high gross profit in a single day, even if it brings the account slightly above breakeven, can indicate inconsistent risk management. We value all trader experiences, but the framework exists to ensure long-term sustainability for both the trader and the firm. Adjusting rules based on individual outcomes would compromise the integrity of the evaluation. Nonetheless, we always welcome constructive input, and we continually review all program features to support fair and professional trading environments.",

Usually after sales, when they see that a lot of new accounts were sold.- Tachnical issues during NY session are very common.- Sometimes account will be deactivated by mistake, this can be resolved, but will take you a couple of days to contact them and prove it. A lot of mess in the support team, this will waste so much of your precious time.In general their policy is to do everything to avoid you from success, even if it's completely wrong and illegal.

Our rules are publicly documented and consistently enforced across all accounts, regardless of when they are purchased. Any updates to policies are communicated transparently and never applied retroactively to disadvantage traders. Technical stability is a top priority, and while rare disruptions can occur, as with any trading platform, our team works swiftly to resolve them. Accidental account flags are uncommon and addressed promptly by our support team, which remains committed to helping every trader succeed. The idea that our firm actively works against traders is entirely false and not supported by the experiences of the vast majority of our funded traders.",

Can you believe it!I guess they do not want to process payout and find all the excuses to stall your payout, especially when it is big. They are keep stalling by emails, and tickets and escalation going nowhere. Fundingtraders is full of hidden schemes and rules, and when you can meet their game and request for payout, they stall it just like me. They paid for few petty cases to make good reviews only.Stay away from this firm!Just an update! I have not still received my payout. What I received is a pending payment notice, and the money never arrived. So by today it is nearly 3 months since the request!",

At FundingTraders, we have a transparent and structured payout process that thousands of traders successfully complete each month. Your payout was never “stalled” arbitrarily; rather, it was subject to clearly stated requirements, including adherence to trading guidelines like news risk ratio and minimum lot requirements, standards that apply equally to all traders, without exception. Once all conditions are met and properly verified, payouts are processed accordingly. Any delays you experienced were due to unmet requirements on your end, not any intention to withhold funds. Our support and escalation teams continuously assist traders through the process, and we do not selectively choose which payouts to process. Assertions of schemes or favoritism are simply false.",

      "content": "Disappointing Experience – Would Not RecommendAt first, everything seems great — they draw you in with tight spreads and attractive offers during the challenge phase. But after passing both challenges, they switch your broker to Preferred Capital, where spreads become outrageous. Pairs like EUR/USD and GBP/USD regularly show spreads between 16–20. They blame “market conditions,” but the spreads remain just as bad even on quiet, no-news days.I also noticed in their Discord payout section that most of the payouts are for small accounts. Larger accounts appear to face significant delays, which raises more concerns.Overall, I strongly recommend staying away. Propfirms like FTMO offer a much more transparent and reliable experience.",

Will such a company honor any payout? In all probability such firms that knowingly keep rules (that are not the industry standard) and which provides them no net benefit (does it make a difference if you trade every 30 days or 21 days on a demo account) but can help them get the funds of a few unlucky people are scams. Please avoid this firm and inform everyone you know they are not to be trusted. No flexibility or understanding or common decency with their support staff who are badly programmed robots.",

Some trades only need to last 30 seconds and this firm is not okay with accepting that without failing your account. They consider it gambling if that’s done multiple times. At least allow traders to do that with funded accounts.",

They have increasing strict rules that no firm has. Now they have a newly implemented news rule. That states if the trade isn’t opened 5 hours before news and closed 5 min before you earn no profits. This can be an issue when funded as if your drawdown was higher than news profits it’s a breach. Secondly the spread on this firm is horrendous. I’m looking at 300+ spread on NZDJPY when all my other accounts on other firms are fine. It should not be a headache to trade with a firm this is ridiculous.",

Our processes are structured, transparent, and governed by a set of risk management principles that are clearly outlined from the start. No trader is ever downsized arbitrarily or without cause. All funded accounts are subject to ongoing evaluation to ensure long-term consistency and risk-aligned trading. In rare cases where account parameters raise significant internal flags, such as inconsistent lot sizing, abnormal exposure patterns, or unsustainable risk behaviors, a temporary adjustment may be made to preserve account longevity. This is not about inventing rules; it’s about upholding the integrity of the program and ensuring all traders meet the same standards. We remain committed to treating every trader fairly and transparently and welcome constructive dialogue from those who wish to understand the reasoning behind account-level decisions.",

      "content": "Unfair Termination, False Claims, and Excuses to Avoid PayoutsI was funded by Funding Traders after successfully completing their evaluation. However, they abruptly terminated my funded account without issuing the payout I had earned, citing a supposed “consistency rule” about trading correlated pairs.They falsely claimed I had been warned previously — a complete lie. No warning was ever given, and the trades they questioned all occurred before their first email. Worse, some members of their own team even acknowledged that, according to their own FAQ, none of my trades actually violated any rules. The idea of \"correlated pair trading\" as a violation seems to be a made-up excuse to deny payouts.I never tried to bypass any rule — I traded based on market setups. The pairs in question (e.g., EURUSD + GBPUSD, USDCAD + USDCHF, CADJPY + EURJPY) are standard, and treating them as violations is absurd. There was no transparency, no real warning, and no fair chance to adjust my strategy — just sudden termination.This looks like a pattern designed to eliminate profitable traders before they cost the firm money. They present themselves as a prop trading firm but behave more like a money trap.Proceed with caution. I would not recommend Funding Traders to anyone serious about trading.--------------------------------Reply to FundingTrader response:Thank you for your response, but I must clarify that your version of events is misleading.No prior warning was ever given about any \"correlated trading violations.\" The trades you flagged were placed before your first email, and there was no opportunity given to adjust my strategy.The pairs I traded — EURUSD+GBPUSD, USDCAD+USDCHF, CADJPY+EURJPY+EURCHF — are widely used and do not violate any published rules. Multiple members of your own team acknowledged in writing that none of these pairs are considered explicitly correlated in your FAQ.You’ve falsely claimed that you warned me in advance, which is simply not true. This undermines your claim of transparency and fairness.It’s clear that these rules are applied selectively and retroactively, and the entire process seems more like a tactic to avoid payouts than a genuine risk concern. I passed your evaluation fair and square, only to have my funded account terminated on vague, unpublished, and inconsistent grounds.This experience makes it clear that FundingTraders is not operating in good faith with traders.",

      "reply_content": "Hey Chandana, We appreciate your feedback, though the version of events you've described does not align with the facts reviewed by our risk and compliance team. Your account was thoroughly evaluated, and the decision to terminate funding was based on repeated violations of correlated trading behavior, which is explicitly outlined in our risk guidelines. The pairs you mentioned, while common, were traded in highly correlated patterns with identical timing and sizing, triggering a clear flag under our internal risk replication criteria. Our consistency protocols are not arbitrary; they are in place to ensure real-world viability of trading strategies for capital deployment. Our goal is to support long-term, sustainable traders, not to penalize profitable ones arbitrarily. We understand these situations can be frustrating, especially after effort has been put into passing evaluations. However, all actions were taken with full transparency and in accordance with our published terms.",

The 2% per-trade risk guideline is not only clearly outlined but actively monitored throughout the evaluation process. Your account was not flagged earlier because the breach in question did not trigger the automated system but was identified during the manual review, which is a standard part of our multi-layered verification process prior to funding. The trade you are referring to was not fabricated, trade logs are recorded automatically and cannot be manipulated. Our team followed the protocol, and the decision was made after a thorough review of your trading history.

      "title": "Stay away from this firm. They will NOT pay you out. (Updated)",
      "content": "I had 4 challenges with this firm. Passed two and failed two. However with one of those evaluations I had requested a payout of over 5k. I followed every single rule with a next gen account. I had a consistency score of 21%, 7 VWHT, and no news trading. However the risk management team admitting that I didn’t break any rules made up their own rules when I requested a payout. Even though their margintale rules don’t apply which is don’t risk over 2% per trade, these guys ended up flagging one trade that I risked more than 1.5% but less than 2% per trade. For that they ended up denying my payout and told me that they would give me a free funded retake or to get a refund for the account. They unjustly rejected my payout instead of sticking to their rules so I’d advise everyone to not waste their time on this firm. They have a good support team via online for mangiusum, Khalifa and Kid, however the risk management team is full of shit and are unfair. Update:5/6/2025 - So I decided to take them up on their offer from risk management to have a funded retake. This time I not only had to follow the FAQ rules (which i followed the first time but still had first payout denied but no problem, i did it once, i can do it again without an issue) but I also have to follow a few new ones that they made specifically for me to follow which were understandable and doable as well. I documented each and every trade individually showing how much I risked and the time it took to close the trade as well. Requested my payout yesterday so I should find out if they'll really pay out or not by tomorrow night since it says it takes up to 48 hours on average to get your payout approved. Will update again when I get a response on here.Update #2: So far its been over 48 hours and about my third day since i requested payout, nothing from Funded Traders. Online support said that my payout was reviewed and to be patient. Update #3: Requested payout on Monday night, its end of the week Friday evening and I just received the contract for rise. Still no payout so we just have to be patient and give them until next week. Next week I should also be able to request a payout. If both are given i might reconsider my review.Update #4: My second payout was approved! The first one was denied but my second was approved after 7-8 days (5-6 business days) via rise as my payment option. I will be doing one last update within a month to see if my third payout request will be approved. If it does then in that case we're going to have to change our review and give it a 4-5 stars afterall. Overall again their customer service including KID, OBIWAN, KHALIFA, and magnisum are awesome as they reply back fast and always helpful in answering your questions as well as directly moving your issues to the rightful department!",

      "content": "Terrible experience – lack of transparency and professionalismFundingTraders is not a serious firm. Their rules are confusing and unclear, and when you try to get a proper explanation or resolve a misunderstanding, they just give generic replies like “that’s our rule,” showing no real interest in helping or being fair to the client.It really feels like they’re just looking for any excuse to disqualify you and keep your money, rather than genuinely evaluating your skills as a trader.I absolutely do not recommend this firm. There are plenty of other companies out there that truly value traders and offer fair, clear, and transparent processes.PD: It’s no secret how your company truly operates. Your business model relies on collecting fees from traders who fail your challenges — or rather, from those you set up to fail. This isn’t just my opinion; it’s a well-known pattern. The rest is obvious: there are countless reviews, shared experiences, and general public sentiment that confirm this reality. What’s more, the majority of the reviews on your profile are clearly solicited by your team and mostly praise the customer service experience — not actual traders successfully making withdrawals, which is what truly matters. The truth is, profitable traders aren’t profitable for your business, and that’s why it feels like you do everything possible to disqualify them. If “thousands” were truly passing and receiving payouts as you claim, your business model wouldn’t be sustainable. Please be more honest and transparent when speaking publicly.",

      "content": "FundingTraders.com Review – Disappointing ExperienceI’ve been trading with FundingTraders.com, and honestly, I’m really disappointed—especially with their new rules. The most frustrating one is the 21-day inactivity rule. Basically, if you don’t trade for 21 days, your account is gone. That means no vacations, no time off for emergencies, or even just taking a break. It’s completely unreasonable and puts unnecessary pressure on traders.On top of that, there are other restrictive rules that make trading with them harder than it needs to be. It feels like the whole system is designed to trip you up rather than help you succeed.To be fair, their support team is responsive, and they do reply quickly, which is a plus. But unfortunately, the support can’t do much when these rigid rules are baked into the platform.Bottom line: I don’t recommend FundingTraders.com. There are better prop firms out there with more trader-friendly policies. Save yourself the frustration and look elsewhere.",

      "reply_content": "Hey Peter, Thank you for sharing your thoughts. While we respect your opinion, we would like to clarify a few key points to avoid any confusion for others reading this. The 21-day activity requirement is not a new or hidden rule, it is standard practice among reputable firms to ensure that accounts remain active and reflective of a trader’s ongoing performance. This rule is in place to promote consistency and discipline, traits we believe are essential for long-term trading success. It by no means prevents traders from taking breaks, many of our users manage their schedules while remaining compliant simply by planning their trades accordingly. As for the claim of “restrictive rules,” our guidelines are designed to create a level playing field and prevent reckless behavior that can harm both the trader and the firm. Many of our traders thrive within this structure and appreciate the transparency we offer from day one. We appreciate your acknowledgment of our responsive support team. While they do operate within our policy framework, they always strive to provide clarity, solutions, and guidance. We remain committed to supporting serious traders with a fair, transparent, and professional environment.",

      "content": "I passed a $200,000 step one challenge and couldn’t funded for using “martingale”strategy, even though I didn’t use that strategy, I didn’t stop there I also passed a 100k Step one challenge in the same week and got told I used martingale like strategy even though I didn’t. these pop firms will claim that they are looking for talented traders But when a trader like, Me who has pinpoint accuracy and passes two challenges in the same week like clockwork that terrifies them because they don’t know whether they want to copy my trades or not once I’m funded.Traders like me who are bit aggressive like me are considered really risky for these prop firms because it’s hard decision for them to copy and execute my trades once funded.If they decide not to copy my trades until they see consistency and i make a large increase in account balance quickly they loose money because they didn’t copy my trades that’s it if they make an excuse to payout which this fraudulent company will most likely do.What I explained in this Review is the Dark manipulative Thought process Of every prop firm and this company is one of them making every excuse not to fund or pay traders even though they market them selves as this “quick cash grab come trade our capital” delusion.Please do extensive research when choosing prop firms, I’ve chosen prop firms where I get funded grow my accounts 20-30% and wait 30 days for payout and get denied, the prop firm industry is a Dark manipulative world be careful and trust the bigger companies don’t be fooled by other prop firms whose challenges are cheaper than others because most likely they are fraudulent…They responded to this dispute and I’ve got over 800 people who viewed my comment and I hit them where it hurts they should change company name from fundingtraders to fundingmaybe? Light will be shed upon of all of these fraudulent “prop firms” mark my words!",

      "reply_content": "Hey Mickey, Thank you for your feedback. We appreciate all perspectives and understand your frustration; however, we must respectfully correct several inaccuracies in your statement. Our evaluation process is strictly rule-based, and all accounts are assessed using identical criteria to ensure fairness and consistency. At no point did we disqualify your accounts arbitrarily or out of hesitation to fund you. The strategies observed during both your challenges displayed distinct patterns consistent with high-risk martingale-style trading, which is clearly outlined as a restricted practice in our terms and conditions. This evaluation was conducted by multiple members of our risk team to avoid any bias or misjudgment. Contrary to your suggestion, we do not fear funding skilled traders, in fact, we celebrate them. Many of our top performers trade aggressively while still adhering to risk parameters and transparency. The implication that we manipulate results or avoid payouts is simply false. Our business thrives on successful traders who are consistent, disciplined, and compliant with our guidelines. We understand that not being approved can be disappointing, but our goal remains to fund long-term, sustainable traders, not just those who pass a challenge. We remain committed to transparency and fairness and encourage all traders to review and understand our rules before participating.",

During the evaluation, I complied with all stated rules and conditions. At no point during the challenge was I clearly informed that the use of a martingale-based strategy—even if applied with controlled risk—would result in disqualification or denial of a funded account after passing.If such a rule exists, it should be transparently and explicitly stated in the challenge terms and conditions, not enforced retroactively. It is both discouraging and frustrating to complete the challenge successfully, only to be denied the account based on vague or undisclosed criteria.I kindly request a formal review of my account and strategy, and a detailed explanation of how my trading violated specific rules. Furthermore, I urge you to consider the importance of transparency and fairness for your traders, especially those who trust your platform enough to participate in evaluations.",

      "reply_content": "Hey Nadif, Thank you for reaching out and for taking the time to express your concerns. We’d like to clarify that our evaluation process is fully transparent and that all trading strategies, including risk models such as martingale, are reviewed under strict internal compliance, criteria that are clearly outlined in our risk disclosures and trader guidelines available prior to the start of any challenge. We take pride in providing all necessary information up front so traders can make informed decisions. Your account was reviewed thoroughly upon completion of the challenge, and the denial of the funded account was not arbitrary. The trading history exhibited characteristics of a high-risk compounding strategy that does not align with our long-term funding objectives. While you may not have identified the method as martingale, the pattern of progressively increased position sizing following losses, regardless of the risk cap, matches the risk model we do not permit. These standards are essential for us to maintain a consistent, sustainable funding model that protects the firm and its traders. This policy is not enforced retroactively; rather, it is part of our standard review to ensure that strategies used during the challenge can be reliably applied in live trading conditions, where capital and risk are real. We value your effort and commitment, and we respect the time you invested. While we understand your disappointment, the decision made by our risk team was aligned with our terms. We remain fully committed to fairness, and we encourage you to review our strategy policies in more detail should you wish to attempt another evaluation in the future.",

      "content": "Prop firm that doesnt deliver on what they claim to be. (They removed my first review)I was waiting to get my refund until i posted my honest and disappointing review. I would stay away from this firm. I spent 2 months on a 50k challenge passing it very consistently! Didnt even risk more than $300 dollars on any open position in which some were closed early avoiding losses but they saw it as “taking small scalps” which is ridiculous. I did not break any rules what so ever but when they “reviewed” my account they came at me with the lame excuse not to give me my funded account after working so hard for it for 2 months on both phases! saying i was “over leveregared” and “took too many scalps”. I dont even scalp. I day trade and swing. The many open and closed positions that had small profit or a very small loss im talking less than $20 dollars were break even trades but they pretended they did not see that and instead used it as an excuse to say they were “short scalps” even tho i did not break any RULES AT ALL. They gave me a refund but that is not the point. We as traders well atleast the profitable traders work so hard and take time to pass a challenge to get a funded account but instead end up doing THIS. I literally wasted 2 solid months only to be given a lame excuse why they werent going to give me my 50k funded account. “Risk management” said in their words that my strategy was unable to be replicated in a “real world environment” since they “copy our trades into a master account”. I trade legit higher timeframe supply and demand zones.   From a financial point, it wouldnt even make sense to copy trades into a real master account and also not even mentioning how on how long it takes to recieve a payout and thats even if you get lucky and dont get your payout denied! Also if you notice, they have 4.4 ratings but the reviews are only because the support members ask you to write a review and its just about them having “good customer service” thats debatable as well. *****Whether you believe me or not im not gonna sit here and argue with funding traders. I just dont recommend this prop firm period. This is a place for reviews from the consumers so here is my review.",

      "reply_content": "Hey Adrian, Thank you for your feedback, but we must clarify that your claims do not accurately represent our practices or policies. Our evaluation process is transparent and consistent across all traders. Your account underwent a thorough review by our Risk Management team, and the decision was based solely on objective trading data. The review identified a pattern of extremely low-risk, rapid trades, commonly referred to as scalping, and a trading approach that consistently relied on overleveraged entries. This is not a subjective opinion, but an assessment based on actual position sizing, execution timing, and trade duration. Funded accounts are granted to those whose strategies are sustainable and reproducible in real market environments. We do not penalize traders for short trades alone, but we do evaluate overall risk exposure and the ability to maintain consistent execution under real conditions, including liquidity and slippage, which differ significantly from simulated challenges. To say we “pretended” not to see your break-even trades is not only incorrect but misleading. Each position was reviewed in detail, and the feedback provided to you was specific and rooted in your trading history. The refund extended to you was a gesture of goodwill, acknowledging your time and effort, even though your strategy did not meet the funding standards. Lastly, our reviews reflect genuine customer experiences. While we encourage traders to leave honest feedback, we do not pressure anyone to post reviews, nor do we remove them unless they violate platform guidelines.",

      "content": "90% of the positive you read here is because they guilt trip you into writing a 5 star review when your facing a problem when reaching out to support. I’m gonna give you the hard truth about funding traders. I’ve been payed out and bought many challenges with them. I’ve become funded on multiple occasions, but rarely get an account because risk management team is not fair at all. I’ve traded my account from 5% drawdown these past 4 weeks to the funded stage (20%) with mostly 1 trade per day, except for this time. I was in phase 2 and I took 2 trades both taking around 3/4 min gaining 3 and 4% around 5min from each other apart, I saw the opportunity. I executed and passed phase 2. Thinking I would receive my funded account I’ve got a message from risk management that my form of trading is gambling. I traded on average 5% per week the last month. I’m not gambling, I backtested for days on end. So they offered me either a refund or a retake account. So today I traded the retake account and guess what, I couldn’t believe the spreads. Spreads went from average 0.15 on gold to now average 0.60 with spikes up to 0.70. This company is NOT TRUTHFULL. The ones responsible will be judged in the eyes of god.I wish I took my money from the get go to FTMO, The5ers, Funding Pips or anything else then this stupid propfirm. I’ve been trough it with these guys, this is not the first time they did this bullshit. They always do it, looking for a way to screw you over. Trust me don’t do it, the chance you become funded when you even reach the evaluation is lower then 10%.",

At FundingTraders, our evaluation and funding decisions are never based on personal bias or arbitrary judgment. Every account undergoes a comprehensive review rooted in objective risk metrics that are clearly outlined. The claim that we \"guilt trip\" traders into leaving reviews is simply false, we encourage all feedback, both positive and negative, and make no attempt to influence it. Your trading activity was assessed based on consistency, sustainability, and adherence to sound risk management principles. Executing two high-risk trades in quick succession that result in a rapid phase pass does not align with the risk framework we have in place for funded accounts. Our goal is to support traders who demonstrate discipline and a long-term, replicable edge, not momentary gains based on highly aggressive strategies. As for spreads, we do not manually adjust them for individual users. Any fluctuations reflect real market conditions and liquidity levels provided by our partners, which affect all traders equally and transparently. We offered a fair resolution, including a retake, as a gesture of goodwill. We stand by our commitment to fairness, transparency, and the success of traders who align with our risk philosophy.",

Firstly, we do not ask for reviews multiple times in a single day, nor do we solicit reviews with the intent to mislead. Any requests for feedback are made sparingly and are entirely optional. We pride ourselves on our transparency and encourage honest reviews, both positive and critical, to help improve our services. Our payout process is clearly outlined in our terms and remains consistent for all traders. We do not deny legitimate payouts for arbitrary reasons, and all assessments are based solely on compliance with our publicly shared guidelines. Lastly, suggesting that we only pay when legal pressure is applied is categorically untrue. We fulfill all valid payouts promptly and fairly. Any delay in your case, if it occurred, would have been tied to ensuring all compliance and risk checks were completed properly, a standard practice across the industry. We remain committed to supporting ethical and consistent traders and are always available to clarify any misunderstandings.",

      "content": "If you are looking for a new prop firm, avoid this one and go for those that have already established a reputation, with clear and fair rules.FundingTraders has many very specific and unfair rules, including limits on single trades that could bust your account even if in the green. Forget the 5% daily rule and 10% total drawdown, these will not be your concern here.I have friends who have had their accounts downscaled or plain deleted because the prop firm didn't agree with their trading approach, even when following all the rules and running consistent profits.It's a zero-sum game with them - Draw you in with enticing rebates, reject your accounts and payouts based on petty rules and frivolous claims.Ahhh, but they'll claim this is to better know their traders and ensure they really only truly work with the worthy ones! Alas, this is only really a tactic to take your investment and encourage you to buy more challenges.They even had the guts to switch users to a Karios server, one that has down times I've never seen before, rendering you unable to trade, unable to close your trades even, while every one else in the world can still trade. Coupled with their insane rules, even if you maniacally try to follow them all, it's a matter of time before you receive an email that your account has been shut down, even if you were deep in the green.A refund for such issues they cause? Not an option, they say.There is no more dishonest, unethical and disgusting than such company that pretends to be so great to its traders, all while busting accounts left and right.You'll recognise the 5 star reviews as being requested by their staff. These ''clients'' are too early in the process to have been screwed - yet. The quick damage control by FundingTraders is evident, as is their money-grab scheme.Trust the many legit and detailed 1 star reviews don't be gaslighted - AVOID.",

And many people on discord told the same.Then i got 2 payouts from them with very long waiting time but still ... On my 3rd payout they denied it with the reasoning that my risk raised and they don´t like that.I posted this on discord, with every trade i took and every single trade matched their rules.After replying to risk management that this is an error, they banned me from discord and terminated my account because i was too profitable.I can proof everything with screenshots and many people on discord were unhappy because of such behaviour.",

All that is mentioned was the VWHT.And yet, when i calculate my own VWHT, it was WAY above VWHT. And yet, they still find fault with you and downsize your funded account.Are you guys looking for consistent traders or trying to eat our money?Lastly, the risk management team response is super slow. my last response was last tues, 2/4/25 and till now it has not been responded.

While our website states that a stop loss is not mandatory, it is strongly encouraged as a best practice for risk management.

While it is true that we provide flexibility, we also assess trading behavior to ensure that it aligns with our overall risk management guidelines.

While specific time frames may not be explicitly stated, our risk management team evaluates all trades based on their adherence to our risk criteria. The review process is thorough to maintain a level playing field for all traders, and it is important to adhere to our trading standards.

While you are correct that there is no outright rule against using tight stop losses, our systems detected a pattern of excessive and repeated risk exposure that exceeded the acceptable thresholds for this type of trading strategy. This was clearly communicated to you during the review process. The offer of 30% payout was made in line with the findings of our comprehensive evaluation, which aims to ensure that all payouts align with our risk management guidelines. We are committed to providing transparent and fair processes, and while the outcome may not align with your expectations, it was in full compliance with our established rules.",

      "content": "Their claim is trade bigger and get paid faster, and they say that payouts are processed within 24/48 hours. I have a 25k funded account, requested my payout 48h ago and the status is still 'for review'. Yesterday I first asked on discord how much would it take and a guy called RIO told me that the review has already been done despite the 'for review' status on the website. I waited a couple hours and nothing changed so I reached out to the website support and they told that it wasn't true, the review wasn't still done. So I asked on discord for an explanation and they muted me for 24 hours. Today I asked again and girl ,I suppose ,called Manawari told that what RIO told me yesterday was the truth so I tried to ask when would I receive my payout and they muted me again, this time for 6 days. There are many people in my same situation and many of them are waiting from way more than me. The staff or support never gives an explanation they only tell people to wait. This way of handling things in unprofessional and unacceptable. I writing this review hoping to get a proper answer from them and to STRONGLY advice people to stay away from them if they don't completely change the way they handle things and start paying people who deserve to be paid.EDIT: today I received an email from the 'risk department' saying that I will receive my full payout and refund but my account will be terminated due to gambling. I had an open ticket without answers so I asked on discord to get an answer. The result? 7 days timeout. I only want to know when I'll receive my deserved payout which I requested a week ago and you'll never hear more from me.",

      "reply_content": "Hey Alessandro, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. We’d like to address your concerns and clarify several misunderstandings to ensure a fair and accurate representation of how our payout system operates. At FundingTraders, we take pride in offering some of the fastest payout processing times in the industry, with the majority of payouts being reviewed and issued within 24 to 48 business hours. We’ve reviewed your Discord and support interactions, while one of our team members may have prematurely mentioned the review was complete, a subsequent audit showed that your account was still undergoing compliance checks. These are necessary steps we take to uphold payout integrity for all traders, not just for individual cases. Our community guidelines are clearly outlined in Discord, and spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt, can lead to short-term mute or server ban to maintain a respectful environment for all traders. This action is never taken to silence valid concerns, but to preserve the professionalism and order of the community space. We’d also like to respectfully correct the claim that “many people are in your same situation.” The overwhelming majority of our traders are paid on time and leave positive feedback both in Discord and on third-party platforms. Isolated issues can occasionally arise, just like in any global operation, but we are always available to clarify and resolve them. That said, we appreciate your patience and are confident that your payout is being handled properly.",

At FundingTraders, we uphold a fair and transparent assessment for all traders. While passing both phases quickly is certainly possible, our evaluation also takes into account proper risk management, trade execution consistency, and adherence to our guidelines. If an account is flagged, it is never without reason, it is due to clear inconsistencies or rule violations that undermine sustainable trading practices. In cases where accounts do not meet our criteria for funded trading, we offer a retake or a refund as a goodwill gesture, ensuring that traders are given another opportunity to prove their skills under conditions that align with real-world market risk. This policy is designed to maintain integrity and fairness across the board. We encourage all traders to carefully review our terms before participating. Our goal is not to fail traders but to fund those who demonstrate discipline and longevity in their trading approach.",

      "content": "I was a trader with FundingTraders and would like to share my experience to help others make informed decisions.After passing the evaluation and receiving a funded account, I was informed that my account would be reduced due to a \"non-replicable strategy\" based on trade duration and risk. When I asked for clarification on what specifically constituted risky trading behavior (e.g. lot size, duration, or movement), I was told that they couldn't provide exact parameters. This made it difficult to understand how the rules were applied or whether similar trades would be allowed in the future.I submitted a payout request (Ref ID: 1294) and experienced a delay beyond the stated 48 business hours. When the payout arrived, the amount was lower than expected. After reaching out, I was informed that it reflected 30% of my 90% profit share — a detail I hadn’t seen clearly communicated. I later received the partial refund that was also part of the termination terms.I also contacted the Risk Department via email to seek further clarification, but I have yet to receive a response, despite it being well past their stated reply window.In my personal experience, clearer communication and more transparency around payout calculations and trading evaluations would go a long way in improving the trader experience.",

At FundingTraders, we pride ourselves on maintaining clear and transparent risk management rules. Our guidelines are designed to promote sustainable trading practices, and any adjustments to account size or terms are based on objective assessments of trading behavior. While we understand that individual trading styles can vary, it’s important to adhere to our established parameters to ensure consistency and fairness for all traders. Regarding the claim of unclear criteria, our risk management policies are explicitly stated. Each trader is responsible for understanding these rules before engaging in trading activities. As for payout requests, we strive to process all transactions within our stated timelines. Any delays that may occur are typically due to reasons out of our control. We handle all cases professionally and transparently, ensuring that traders receive the funds they have earned, in accordance with our payout structure. The suggestion that accounts are terminated without proper warning is misleading. Our risk management team conducts thorough reviews and only makes decisions based on clear evidence of rule violations. Any trader who engages with our platform in good faith is treated fairly, and we remain committed to supporting responsible trading practices. We value the input of all our traders and are always looking for ways to improve our services.",

Which is NORMAL when trading Nasdaq. No need to swing trade for days!And guess what? Got flagged for: GAMBLING.Anyone who wants to trade with fundingtraders don’t do it, whenever you reach your goal in 1 day, or in a few hours.. you are gambling! I had 3 wins, and a small loss. I send them my whole set up. They don’t care. ‘Try again’ Well thanks for the refund. Never EVER EVER again funding traders for me. All the messages you see with a 5 star is of customer services! How ‘great’ they are.Hence also their ‘secret’ rule. If you make TWO losses within 2 min time difference in between them, they count them as ONE. So if you by accident make more than 2% loss, you WONT get notified. But when you complete your goal (say you work a month on it) THEN they’ll tell you, ‘you made to much loss in a trade’They are a disgrace. I’m done. Bye fundingtraders",

At FundingTraders, our policies regarding trading behavior and risk management are clearly outlined and designed to promote responsible trading practices. Achieving your profit target in one day, while impressive, does not exempt trades from being assessed against our rules. The claim that you were flagged for \"gambling\" reflects a determination by our risk management team that your trading pattern did not align with the sustainable practices we require. Regarding your setup and trading strategy, our team reviews all accounts objectively, and decisions are based on compliance with our established guidelines, not personal judgments. We maintain strict risk parameters to ensure fairness for all traders, and any violations, such as exceeding loss limits, are communicated transparently. The suggestion that we have \"secret\" rules is entirely false. We strive to provide an excellent trading environment, and many traders have successfully achieved their goals while adhering to our guidelines.",

      "content": "Title: SCAM Tactics Disguised as “Rules” – AVOID Funding TradersThis firm is an absolute joke. I took their 2-Step Challenge, followed proper risk management, and stayed well within lot size discipline. Despite that, they disqualified me for supposedly breaking their so-called “consistency rule” — a vague, poorly defined, and conveniently enforced clause they use to fail traders.Here’s the catch: I placed three separate trades, not simultaneously, each with clear intent and spacing. Yet because the trades were opened or closed within two minutes of each other, they grouped them together and claimed I risked over 2% — which is false. It’s a blatant manipulation of their own rules to fail accounts once you get close to passing.They don’t support traders — they trap them with ambiguous technicalities. The consistency rule is nothing more than a loophole for them to pocket challenge fees without ever funding real traders. It’s predatory, dishonest, and unethical.There are way better prop firms out there that treat traders with respect and fairness. Funding Traders? Avoid them like the plague. Save your money and your time.",

Our consistency rule is clearly stated in our terms, and it is designed to promote responsible risk management, ensuring traders demonstrate sustainable trading habits rather than relying on high-risk bursts. Marking an account as failed because of a rule violation is not an arbitrary decision but a standard practice across reputable prop firms to maintain integrity and fairness in funded trading. We understand that traders may be disappointed when they do not qualify, but our goal remains the same: to reward disciplined, consistent traders who follow our guidelines. Our track record of funding and paying successful traders speaks for itself.",

FundingTraders has successfully funded and paid thousands of traders who follow the rules, and we operate with full transparency. The suggestion that \"all five-star reviews are fake\" is simply untrue. The positive feedback we receive comes from real traders who appreciate our platform, our fair trading conditions, and the support we provide. Just because some individuals choose to violate our rules or fail to meet the required standards does not mean the firm is a scam. Payouts are processed according to our clearly stated policies. If you did not receive one, it was due to a violation of terms, not because of any deceptive practices. Our terms are publicly available, and traders are expected to comply. Claiming that we \"make up rules\" is just an excuse for those who do not meet the necessary requirements. At FundingTraders, we remain committed to rewarding disciplined and professional traders.",

I took a screenshot and stated that was a lie and I was kicked out of their discord…very fishy if you ask me. They are quick to kick people off discord but take weeks of not months to pay people and somehow are upset when you mention it on discord. It is not spreading misinformation or spreading panic or fear when it does in fact take weeks or months to pay people what they have rightfully earned. I am not manipulating anybody’s perception as they can just easily become part of the discord, get funded, and then go through what everyone else is going through and see if my review is “false”. And then you try to flag my review to get it removed which shows how shady you guys are and do not like having negative reviews that are the actual experiences of many in that company waiting for payouts. Rather you ask us to leave your customer service people a great review on trustpilot to boost up your ratings.",

FundingTraders has always maintained clear and transparent policies regarding payouts, which are processed efficiently within the stated timeframes. If delays occur, they are due to external factors, not any attempt to withhold funds. As for Discord moderation, traders are only removed for violating community guidelines, such as spreading misinformation or creating unnecessary panic, fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Constructive discussions are always welcome, but false accusations and disruptive behavior will not be tolerated. Your narrative conveniently ignores the hundreds if not thousands of successful payouts processed on time and the overwhelming number of traders who continue to receive their rewards without issue. The attempt to portray our company as \"fishy\" is unfounded and misleading. If you have a legitimate concern, we encourage professional communication through the proper channels, rather than attempting to manipulate public perception.",

Claims that payouts are denied without cause are entirely false. Every trader is subject to the same terms and conditions, which are clearly outlined before they begin trading. Any payout denials occur only when there is a breach of these terms. The suggestion that we have liquidity issues is completely untrue. We continue to process payouts regularly, as evidenced by the many traders who receive their withdrawals on time. Our outreach to former traders is simply part of our commitment to providing opportunities and ensuring they are aware of new benefits, promotions, and improvements within our firm. This is a standard practice in any business and should not be misinterpreted as a sign of instability. Finally, implying that our 5-star reviews are not genuine is misleading and unfair. We encourage reviews from all traders, and the positive experiences shared by many reflect the dedication of our team to providing excellent service and support.",

Our trailing drawdown mechanism is transparent and applies equally to all traders, as detailed in our terms and conditions. Be advised that the daily loss limit for 1-step accounts is relative to starting day's equity. The equity was up so high that when the daily drawdown was reset, the daily limit went up above the balance, which caused the account to be marked as \"Failed\". Due diligence is important as a trader.",

      "content": "Since March 3rd, the updated news rule makes it nearly impossible to be a day or swing trader with this prop firm, only scalpers can use this firm now. Lets say for example, the London session opens at 8:00 AM GMT. It often takes time to find a proper setup, so you might enter a trade around 8:30 or 9:00 AM GMT. By the time the US market opens at 1:00 PM GMT, and with news often dropping around 1:30 PM GMT, this rule would affect your trade. Even though it was based on a setup from the London open, you’d still be impacted. With these new rules, swing traders can’t trade most days unless they focus only on the Asian session, as London news is less frequent. However, there’s US news around the US  market open almost every day, which means swing traders are basically  blocked from trading most days. I have never seen more ridiculous rule in any prop firm, please if u  don't know how to avoid news trading gamblers on your firm just copy the system bigger firms have because this rule makes no sense and it needs fix as soon as possible.",

Our updated news trading rule is designed to ensure that traders are not exposing their accounts to excessive volatility and uncertainty caused by high-impact news events. This rule does not prevent day or swing traders from operating successfully, it simply encourages a more strategic approach to risk management. Many traders continue to execute their strategies effectively by planning around scheduled economic events, just as they would in a real trading environment. It’s important to note that high-impact news has always been a factor in risk management, and similar guidelines exist across the industry. We welcome constructive feedback and remain committed to refining our policies to support our traders while maintaining a responsible trading environment.

      "content": "Well, lets start from that i requested payout from them 3 times on same account: 1st time 5k$ they asked me to do more trades, I did and requested again and waited 17 days and was rejected again and asked to do more trade, and I did and asked 3rd time for payout of 9500$ ( had more than 11k$ profit on account) after few hours my account was reviewed and they told me that I will receive payment on Monday, on Tuesday I msged them in a chat they said everything is fine and nothing to worry about my payout already in process, 30 min later I received an email from Risk Department that saying I violated consistency rule because I opened 2 trades:First trade was opened at 16:10:11 and closed at 16:49:40second trade was opened AFTER not simultaneously!!!   1st trade was closed at 16:50:18 and closed at 17:10:23it was the same pair and in the same direction, i didn't open trade while the first was here, only afterIt's obvious that I didn't break any rules, otherwise their system would have blocked my account right away, + my account was reviewed on Friday, and they didn't find anything, now they decided to make something up, and it's clear that they just don't wanna pay It was 9500$ payout !!!And the funniest part is I was kicked from the funded discord, even so i have more accounts with this prop firmThere are plenty of people who wait their payouts for weeks and months if its more than 2-3k$ stay away from these guysIf you need I can provide all screenshots with all conversations",

And then, to top it all off, the same company turns around and adds Martingale themselves? It’s crazy and feels like a gut punch. I really urge you to dig into this. I even received the failed email after passing the evaluation, only for things to flip a few days later with Martingale suddenly in the picture. Just disappointing.Ill add proof with pictures and dates somewhere that allows the posting of pictures for reviews.They have blocked me from the discord group and deleted my honest review in their conoany. I have proof and screen records of it. By far the worse prop trading experience I've had in my years of trading. Hope this helps you as a reader STAY AWAY",

      "content": "I am funded with a few different prop firms and I do trade my own capital.I have a very simple strategy I just buy pull backs after breakouts on gold. I will often place a small limit order maybe (0.3%) of my total trade idea risk on the first fib level with a stop way below. So naturally a lower lot size.This is just to be in the market if it runs off from the first level. Giving me then chance to bring in the stop and scale in. And then I have the rest of my pending orders maybe 0.5 or 0.7% of my risk waiting at my ideal fib level.The total risk per trade is less than or equal to 1% but as the second position has a tighter stop loss (as in the entry is closer to the stop loss) the lot size is slightly larger. This apparently is a martingale strategy (nonsense) and they closed my account. I think this is ridiculous. if a stop loss is in place and risk is calculated properly you cannot attach the label martingale to a trading strategy. It is simply understanding your risk and executing a trading strategy.  --- update 20/2/25----Yes your response is fine and to be expected. My review is an opinion and based on my experience only. However....Obviously greater weight is added to my opinon when read in conjunction with the other 14 pages of negative reviews who all seem to share similar grievances.A constructive solution might be to relax this \"Martingale like\" rule and allow traders to trade their position as long as they adhere to the set risk parameters\"Update: 9/5/25I received an email at 9:30 AM to say that Funding Traders had flagged this review as containing defamatory content. And at 9:32 the review had been checked and determined as to not be defamatory. I think my message to anyone thinking about trading with this prop firm, trade with caution, better not at all. The multiple reviews speak volumes on the expected outcome for people looking to trade with them.",

Thank you support agent Obiwan for helping me get my account back up and running! I plan to keep working with them and in the future!Edit-- literally hours after my account was re activated and I left positive review and after it was approved, my account was once again taken away! I didn't appreciate that, and when I questioned what happened, was told the rule change applied only to challenge accounts. When I asked how does the time limit make sense when they state that there is no time limit for challenge accounts then I was told now there is but nothing changed for funded which I had.

However, due to slippage, the trade closed at -$1,200—a $300 difference.I've traded with Apex, Topstep, and Tradeday, and this platform has, by far, the worst slippage.

In other words, I should have left an extra 0.6% buffer to compensate for their poor execution.Save your time and moneystay away from this platform.",

It is not unique to our platform and can affect all traders regardless of their strategy. Our consistency rule explicitly states that traders must account for slippage when managing risk, as it can occasionally result in slightly higher losses than anticipated. This is a fundamental part of trading and risk management. All evaluations are conducted fairly, and account breaches only occur when a trader violates the established rules.

      "content": "I've just lost my 50k challenge for absolutely 0 fault on my side. What happened? As you know they have 2% max. risk per trade. I have been using strictly 0.5%($250) stoplosses on every trade I placed. Today my stoploss wasn't triggered on trade resulting of loss -920 USD. My account balance at the time was almost 51k so I don't get how it could lead to loss of the challenge. It is not 2%. This loss was purely technical execution fault either of a broker or a trade locker app. I had my -250 USD stoploss placed on a trade. When I made inquiry about it, support from Funding traders didn't help of course. They wrote something like they didn't find any irregularities. Not fair at all! 100% staying away from this company. Never purchase any challenge from them anymore and highly recommend not to so to anyone else if you don't want to lose your account just anytime no matter how much you try to be consistent, following your plan, risk management and all this when you can be taken down by system failure at any time..I'm more than happy to receive a response from the company re this issue here. I will happily adjust my negative review if they review my issue. But it is apparent they don't care about clients when they face technical issues leading to account closure. I knew 100% all the rules and did respect them and trade accordingly. Yet still I wasn't able to avoid loss of the account because when stoploss isn't triggered there's really zero chance for a trader to be able to do anything. It happened within seconds of big spike candle. I didn't have time to close trade manually. That's why we place stoplosses on our trades. But when they don't work what else can we do? Please think twice before purchasing a challenge from this company, you won't get any support if you face similar situation like this one. I'm real person, not an anonymous \"hater\" my intentions are not to harm a company reputation. I wrote my review just to help other traders make better choice before purchasing a challenge from Funding traders. Re: I add a comment after receiving response from Funding traders. They claim I have not placed a stoploss on my trade. Because there is no evidence on either side it is impossible to judge this review. I knew I've placed my stoploss because I don't trade without it in any case and I did see it clearly on a trade locker during my trade execution. But just the fact you have to be \"fighting\" to prove it shows their rules aren't very traders friendly because they are the only Prop firm (I know) that has the limit 2% per trade, which easily leads to account termination due to splippage, delayed stoplosses execution etc..",

Only constant discounts (that is good for your wallet, but shows that they try to attract more users) and ability to buy big accounts, but this imho is possible just because if their bunch of hard rules. I can not say anything about it's funded accounts, because they denied after passing challenge due to breaching consistency rule (one stop was 2.05% instead of maximum 2).Also they have more weird rules.1. Martingale rule. You can not add more than once to your already loosing position. So a lot of strategies are not able to use with this company2. 1-step program is the worst I have ever seen. Besides that your daily loss decreased to 4% and maximum loss to 5%, the most weird thing is that your maximum loss is relates to your maximum balance (wtf). So you can make intraday +3%, that take loss 1% and your maximum loss turns to be 4%, dispite your overall profit for example 5%, daily profit 2%, but you are in loosing situation. So you can not take good positions with higher stop-loss, because your situation never turns to be good enough for risk, you can not stay away from your maximum loss, you can only become closer to lose your account. So you always fell psychological pressure.It seems to be a trap, because usually 1-step and 2-step programs difference is size of maximum losses. And they will not change your account even if you are in profit and just discovered this ruleThere is no reasons to choose this prop-firm, imho. A lot of rules that can be used against you.",

On top of that i had same trades running on other firms accounts and interestingly i have seen no effect there but at fundingtraders it widened by 40 pips and i am not the only one who faced this lots of traders complain same in the discord but they don't care.

      "content": "I used to really defend funding traders above other propfirms. I am a super big believer in customer service, support,clarity of rules. Bt today I realized that I was wrong. After fighting and battling through my phase 1&2 challenges they told me I'm not going to get funded. Because I placed a trade before news happened and even kept the trade open after news but because I made a significant amount of money they are choosing to not honor my trade. As a trader I've purchased over 16 challenges through them because I believed in the company and their customer support. But as of today the way the handled me both in discord and through email is unacceptable. I will however say that they did give me an option to eith re-take the whole challenge or refund my money. Which is positive for them. The simple fact being I broke no rules and the way they banned me from discord for asking question and trying to gain clarity is sooo unprofessional!!! They didn't even give an option to say you know what we'll give you the chance to retake phase 2. No they want me to take phase 1&2 over again. Mind you they gave me my phase 2 credentials weeks ago and when I finally pass phase 2 and am waiting for my funded credit also decide to tell me my phase 1 is no good. How do you do that to someone? Especially a loyal client who's spent so much money with your firm. So with funding traders be very careful of their rules. Also remember their drawdown rules as well. And even though they say news trading allowed it's at their discretion!!! Definitely go with a firm that honors their rules and payout procedures! I also have all my screenshot and correspondences between me and funding traders to show how unprofessionally they treated me and my situation today. Especially when all I wanted was clarity and to come to an amacable resolution.",

      "content": "I’ve had an extremely disappointing experience with Funding Traders and feel compelled to share it. My trades have been repeatedly stopped out despite being 20 or more pips away from my set stop loss, which is completely unacceptable. When I raised the issue with their support team, I was told it was due to “spread widening” caused by low liquidity, and that my stop loss is triggered by the bid or ask price, which isn’t visible on my MT5 chart. As a swing trader who holds positions overnight or over the weekend, this explanation doesn’t justify the fact that my trades—often in good profit—get unfairly stopped out. When I asked for a solution to prevent this from happening in the future, the support team didn’t respond and went ahead to close my ticket without any resolution. This was the second time I raised this issue, and each time it was dismissed without meaningful assistance.The combination of unfair trading conditions and terrible customer support that closes your support ticket without resolution is unethical, doesn't inspire confidence and makes Funding Traders highly unreliable. A legitimate prop firm will prioritize transparency, fairness, and customer support, none of which I experienced here. If you’re a serious trader, I recommend looking for a firm with better practices and accountability.Happy to update my review if my issue is fixed, until then, it'll remain so others can be aware.",

To those who opted for this firm, I sympathize; there are certainly better alternatives with standard rules that don’t seem designed to block payouts. The process is slow, and the treatment feels dishonest and disrespectful. I apparently broke one of their clearly stated rules (martingale), but it’s such a dumb rule to impose on traders. They claim it’s meant to prevent traders from going all in, but I risked under 0.5%, so how could I possibly blow my account? It’s just a convenient excuse for them to avoid paying out. Funny enough, they didn’t catch this during the evaluation phase—only when it came time for payout. And after failing me, they had the audacity to offer a 20% discount code. That alone is a major red flag for any prop firm.",

(context they actually say it is only not to pay me cuz, the fun part wasn't martigale and i did close manual the trade on negative) sooooo... doesn’t matter what u do they gonna provide u with the most sh*tty problem only to not validate ur account or something else, make whatever u want i don't provide financial advice at all but better when u can see ur money on ur broker. Peace. Scared of the truth? cuz u dont let my comment here. *fundingtraders.com has flagged your review because they don’t think it’s based on a genuine experience.* Yes it is a based experience. They think they can grasp on a rule that actually i didnt violate basically when is convenient for them. After all im not the only one, somebody made it to the withdrawal but they denied cuz they saw he made a *error* like mine hahaha on his already passed acc after they validate him and said to him that his withdrawal is a impossible one, no chance he made 5-10k. Dont be a fool i work with several prop firms, and this one truly surprised me. And for the others thinking; bro I have my 5-10k acc ur tripping, no no I’m not u are thinking they are legit, the moment u gonna pay an big acc and put all ur effort, only to get unapproved and without money, cuz okey paying you 100$ from a 10k acc is nothing, but 2,3,4 kilos, is more difficult and every month, If you value your time, don’t get an account here because, even if you try to control your trade risks, you won’t be able to.",

As per our policy, technical difficulties on the trader’s end do not exempt them from meeting the evaluation requirements. Additionally, we do not ignore customer inquiries. Every support ticket is thoroughly reviewed, though response times may vary depending on volume. If your request was delayed, it was not intentional. Our evaluations are conducted fairly, and your failure was due to not meeting the required criteria, not any fault on our end.

However, the trade was closed at -$2,039, which is already a violation.The instrument was Nasdaq, the lot size was 0.14, it was the Asian session, and there were no news events. The slippage amounted to $339, and the account was blocked.I work with several prop firms, and this one truly surprised me.

Therefore my account was canceled by mistake.I really hope that the CEO will see and consider this assessment personally and will be able to influence this situation.",

I reached out to the support teams email and also the discord support team and they were absolutely amazing and analyzed what the problem was and fixed the issue and then reinstated my account that allowed me to continue my challenge. After they fixed the issue I made a few more profitable trades and passed my first phase of the challenge.

I put in a support ticket to report the bug and included I paid on 12/31...started purchase on 12/30 to make sure it was applied...I had to finalize checkout...it sent me an email saying it was a problem with my payment when there wasn't. SO there had to been a tech issue. I attempted to enter ticket and support used the flawed invoice that didn't reflect code which was the damn complaint that my code wasn't applied and then put me in time out on Discord. I had numerous platform fails, server fails, and blackouts that blew challenges daily drawdowns due to reset timer. Several challenges were sabotaged. I had several daily drawdown violations after platform opened multiple trades that I never entered due to fails, so I never officially blew some of my challenges my dashboard was bugged. Since then the dashboard has been updated to a nice format I like so I thought the revamp was an improvement in practice I have to restate how messed up it is that I called to report bug and get access to second account I PAID FOR and be treated like a Liar by OBI WAN and placed me in a time out because he didn't understand that my complaint was the code wasn't applied and used the invoice that I was complaining about to say I didn't apply a code rather than deducing a tech bug. A damn Joke. He put me in time out on Discord without truly understanding my complaint...lol. As long as I've been trading with them What sense would it be that I would make the mistake of not being sure to apply a BUY ONE GET ONE FREE CODE but I paid attention enough to pay on 12/31/24. I thought they respected experienced traders more. IM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS COMPANY AT ALL AT THIS POINT!!UPDATE: it absolutely was charging me 99 dollars at first and then it changed to 100 dollars at checkout...all you guys have to do is go into your checkout log to see the code was indeed applied and I received an email to finalize  my checkout. I stated in complaint to support that it was charging me 99 dollars at first then changed to 100 dollars at checkout. I wrote that in support ticket. I really dont feel you looked into it honestly. The most interesting thing about all this is instead of preserving a net positive relationship and resolving it with a benefit of the doubt bonus account because I ended up paying more to receive a Bonus account for the same money you insist on trying to make me look bad and inaccurate review. I have a new complaint. ABSOLUTELY PISS POOR CUSTOMER RETENTION. YOU ARE TRYING TO make me look like a LIAR. RESOLVING THIS ISSUE PROPERLY would've cost you nothing because the code was an additional account that was already covered by what I paid. Because of the lack of self awareness, you've escalated a rather simple issue to resolve by insisting that somehow I made a mistake. Your company's platform has plenty of tech bugs and its documented.",

Our system shows no record of any promo codes being used with the account you provided. Additionally, if the BOGO code had been applied correctly, the total cost would have been $99 instead of $100, reflecting an additional $1 discount. This suggests the issue occurred on your end during the checkout process.",

      "content": "THIS PROP FIRM IS A SCAMI successfully completed phase 1 and 2 for a 200k evaluation requiring 10%. I took 2 trades and gained 1%. I also purchased 7-day Payout Ad on, which cost an extra 20% of the final cost. It took them 3 weeks to review my Payout Request and at the end the told me I violated the Martingale rule. When they showed me my trades that violated the rule, it was 2 positions, 1 of .02 lots and the other was .03 lots. So the breached my account and denied my payout over .01 lots, less than a penny.Before they violated me, I purchased a second account as well. I continued trading this account just to see if they would do the same shady thing and of course they did. Same exact thing  except this time it was after I passed phase 2, it took 3 weeks for them to review just to breech my account and take my hard earned money. They claimed I violated the rule in phase 1 by placing a position that was .01 and another that was .02. I explained to them that this is a common issue when trading on a trade copier and is not a violation of any sort. The funny thing is, I trade with multiple prop firms at a time on a trade copier, and I took the exact same trades with other firms who have the same rules and they honored the agreement and paid me.Their response was BS \"we have to have strict rules to make a fair trading environment for everyone. Except I am apart of \"everyone\" and this is completely unfair to me. I understand Rules and I do my best not to violate them but to take my money and my account over less than 1 cent TWO TIMES is BOGUS.I've been trading with Prop Firms for over 2 years now, I've had good and bad experiences, this is by far the worst company I've ever done any type of business with in any space.Look closely at the bad reviews, you will see many people have this same exact complaint. You will also see a rep from this firm in the comments trying to justify but there is no justification for such shady and predatory business practices. PLEASE STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PROP FIRM. ONCE THEY BREACH YOU , THEY WILL NOT GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY BACK AND YOU WILL HAVE WASTED VALUABLE TIME AND MONEY.Edit: Just as I mentioned, they responded with mention of \"Fairness\" but fail to realize that this is in fact not fair to anyone. We are talking about incremental and fractional amounts here. I paid $3000 for 2 accounts and had $2500 payout due yet you take away all of that over $0.01. Yeah totally fair. Like I said, this prop firm is a joke and a rip off",

It is essential for us to uphold the integrity of our trading rules to ensure a level playing field for all traders.

There are a lot of helpful people in the company and they respond pretty fast even if they can’t resolve the issue right away. - Decent trading conditions- Good communityCons:- Slow payout as it took 9 days for my first payout. During the 9 days, I was not able to trade. The larger the payout, the longer it will take for them to pay you. - Did not receive the 100k after passing both phases. Instead, I received 50k because the risk team said “Most of the profits of your evaluation came from only 1 trade in both of your phases”.  I wished they said that from the beginning. However, they did refund me the price difference and gave me the chance to still receive the 100k account if I gain 10%.- The dashboard sometimes glitches (minor issue).To be fair, they are pretty new and the holidays made it more difficult to process everything. Also, they do plan on launching a lot of cool stuff in the future. But as of now, the firm has a lot of work to do and there is room for improvement. I want to thank Bugsplat, Sensei, Leo, and Ced for helping me with some of my issues.",

      "content": "My experience with this proprietary trading firm has been incredibly disappointing and unprofessional. The company appears to be mismanaged and lacks transparency, raising serious concerns about their integrity. After over six weeks of waiting for a payout, my request has been denied twice. The reason provided was that I closed trades more than 30 minutes before a scheduled news event—a rule that was retroactively enforced. This directly contradicts their website, which explicitly states that news trading is allowed. Additionally, I received an email from the company outlining that only trades executed within 10 minutes before and after news events would be considered news trading. The additional 30-minute restriction was only communicated on their Discord server, which I also adhered to. Despite fully complying with these rules, my payout was still denied.Customer support has been unhelpful throughout this process, often ignoring inquiries or closing tickets without resolution. Unfortunately, I am not alone in facing these issues. A review of their Discord community reveals a troubling pattern of similar complaints, with numerous traders reporting denied payouts and retroactively applied rules seemingly designed to avoid paying clients.This lack of consistency, transparency, and professionalism makes it impossible for me to recommend this firm. I strongly advise anyone considering their services to stay away as far as possible. Talked to risk team for 2 Months, they ended up closing my account and paying me 30% of my payout without any rule breach, Im taking legal action now. Check their Discord and other ratings before purchasing. Theyre a complete scam and wont be around for much longer",

      "title": "Please Read \"Unfair Practices and Lack of Transparency\"",
      "content": "Please Read before buying funding traders challenge.My experience with Funding Traders has been deeply disappointing. I participated in their $50,000 account challenge and successfully passed both Phase 1 and Phase 2, adhering strictly to all their stated rules and guidelines. Despite this, my funded account was not approved, and their reasoning was both arbitrary and unsupported by any of their documented policies.  Upon thoroughly reviewing their website, help center, and terms of service, I found no mention of rules regarding time limitations on trades or restrictions on short scalps. Yet, these unstated criteria were cited as the basis for their decision. This lack of transparency wastes participants' time and undermines trust in their evaluation process.  Furthermore, their claim of over-leveraging was baseless. If over-leveraging were truly an issue, the account would have been blown. Instead, I exercised proper risk management, which they should have recognized and rewarded. Penalizing traders for following sound trading practices not only contradicts their own principles but also diminishes their credibility as a professional firm.  The handling of my case has been unprofessional and reflects poorly on the company. I urge potential customers to be cautious when dealing with Funding Traders. My experience suggests they enforce arbitrary rules that are not communicated upfront, wasting both time and effort.  Additionally, their refund process has been inconvenient. I do not have a Stripe account and requested a direct refund to my bank account, but this issue remains unresolved.  In conclusion, I would not recommend Funding Traders to serious traders. Transparency, fairness, and professionalism are critical in this industry, and unfortunately, they have failed to demonstrate any of these qualities.",

      "content": "News trading is allowed in their trading rules, and after I passed my 100k account, the risk department said that most of my profits were made through news trading. The second point is that they need to maintain consistent trading, so set an order with a stop loss amount that cannot exceed 2% of your total capital. ok I also agree with this point of view, but the lots calculated based on different stop loss pips are also different, especially when the market fluctuations are small, under the same stop loss amount, different order lots will be calculated. So in this case, they directly reduced my 100k account to 50k account, and I don’t know if I chose 100% profit sharing, which wasted my time and energy, which is unacceptable.last updateI received a partial refund.But this is not the point.The rules they wrote on their official website are inconsistent with the actual operations.‘Consistency Rule Representation:Allowed:Open GOLD BUY (2% risk/loss) > Close trade > Open GOLD BUY (2% risk/loss) > Close trade2% risk/loss on single trade idea. Open GOLD BUY (2% risk/loss) > Open AUDUSD BUY (2% risk/loss) > Open GBPJPY SELL (2% risk/loss) >  Close trade2% risk/loss(each) on multiple trade ideas. Open GOLD BUY (1% risk/loss) > Open GOLD BUY (1% risk/loss) > Close trade2% risk/loss on single trade idea.’Every order I make is based on market volatility.Since a 2% loss/rise is allowed, the size of my stop loss pips will affect the position size.The 1% loss/rise I set for the stop loss pips of 200pips and 400pips will cause my position size to be doubled.You said that 2% loss/rise is allowed, but then you warned me that the different position sizes caused by doing so are not allowed.This thing is really ridiculousGuys, don’t trust prop firms with huge discounts (40%)",

I have purchased a 100k challenge with this firm and spent my 2 month time period to pass both phase 1 and phase 2. I didn’t broke any rules and made 10000 $ for phase 1 and 5000$ for phase 2 . But after I finished both phases they said they need to review my account and said that I am failed without any reason. I put stop loss for every positions and never loss more than 2% per trade that’s the rule they have. I followed it completely.They are trying to find something stupid to fail you and not giving you funded account. They just wanted to make money by scamming people. Please don’t buy from these people . I want to give them zero rating but there is no option.",

      "title": "I recently had a frustrating experience…",
      "content": "I recently had a frustrating experience with Funding Traders regarding their rule enforcement and overall trader support. Here are the key issues I faced, along with ongoing complaints that seem common among other traders:\t1.\tAlleged Rule Violation: I was accused of violating their policy on adding positions to losing trades. Their rules explicitly state that a trader may add only one position to a losing trade idea, provided it is not larger than the first position. The flagged trades were:\t•\tTrade IDs: 2952774, 2960519, 2961428\t•\tTrade IDs: 2934316, 2931232, 2941041After careful analysis, it is clear that my trades followed these rules. No excessive position sizes, martingale strategies, or grid trading techniques were used. Even their own AI assistant confirmed that I did not break any rules, but their risk team insisted otherwise, which feels arbitrary and unfair.\t2.\tPayout Delays: A significant problem with Funding Traders is the long payout delays. Many traders, have faced excessive waiting periods for withdrawals, despite fulfilling all profit split requirements. Additionally, there are frequent complaints about payouts being delayed by the risk team, who often ask traders to “trade minimum 5 more orders for another week” if they generate significant profits from a single trade. This kind of stalling tactic is highly unprofessional.\t3.\tUnclear and Inconsistent Rules: Many traders complain about Funding Traders’ interpretation of their own rules. The guidelines are vague, and enforcement often seems to be a matter of opinion rather than clear-cut policy. For example, common practices like closing and reopening trades or splitting positions are penalized despite being allowed in the stated rules.\t4.\tCommunity Complaints: These issues are not isolated. There are numerous complaints from traders about delayed payouts, inconsistent rule interpretation, and a lack of transparency. It seems the firm prioritizes finding loopholes to penalize traders rather than fostering a supportive trading environment.Conclusion:While Funding Traders promises a good funded trading experience, their execution leaves much to be desired. Long payout delays, arbitrary rule enforcement, and poor communication make it difficult to trust the platform. Traders should exercise caution when using this service, especially if they are serious about consistent payouts or fair treatment.I strongly urge Funding Traders to address these issues, clarify their rules, and improve their payout processes to regain trader trust.",

      "content": "Hi everyone;I never comment or complain usually about any company but this time I could not stand for it. I passed phase 1 and phase 2 of the challenges and while I was waiting for my funded account, they regretted to give me a funded account and the excuse was I failed the %2 risk rule. I have been trading for over 8 years and I know how to calculate my stop loss limits including spreads and everything. I calculated each of my trades carefully to not fail on the %2 rule but because of slippage 3 of my trades were closed way different than my stop loss price. And the slippage difference price difference was around $200-$300. I understand that slippage can be $100-$150 on a $100.000 challenge account which is 20 lots per GBPUSD trade but come on not $300 slippage to force you to fail the challenge. (it wasn’t even rollover time as I'm a day trader it was on the London session) Whoever knows how to trade will understand this is too much and traders can only calculate the spreads difference but not the broker's slippage difference because it always changes. I also have evidence of my trades that I could show them, but they keep sending me the same emails. So now I accepted that they wouldn’t give me a funded account, and I asked for a refund, but now they also don’t want to give me a refund. Imagine you spend a lot of effort and time to pass the challenge, and they are just basically stealing all your hard work. This is not fair at all and everyone who reads this PLEASE PLEASE do not buy any challenges from this company as they are not honest about their rules at all. At least they could have offered me a refund as it wasn’t my false at all but they don’t even bother to do that. This shows clearly that they are only making money from your challenge fees. I will seek another option to complain about this company if I could (I don’t think I could find a way), but at least I could try every possible way. Again, I never write any complaints usually, and I had challenges in the past with many prop firms, but come on, this is not acceptable, and everyone should stay away from this company while there are other options like FTMO or other trustworthy ones.",

I opened two trades 1 min and 41 seconds apart from each other. Violating their 2 minute trade rule. Instead of violating me they allowed me to continue to trade that account for nearly 3 months. Just to deny me after I passed phase 2. A more credible company like FTMO would have worked with me. I displayed great trading skills during both phases. Just go on youtube. Where is all of the traders getting payouts from this company at? All they have is a couple people on their youtube account. Save your money.

Whenever I asked, they said they are reviewing and asked me to wait more. They did not provide any evidence that I violated their rules because I did not violate anything. They simply did not want to pay my profit. When I waited without a response, I posted on #general-chat of FT discord, they always deleted my post. To me, it is shady, a scam to take the profit that I deserve. I want my request to be resolved and receive my profit.  Can anyone from Fundingtrades help me out? Or after 3 months, it will be another wait and I will never get the money??? I am really disappointed. From account #805278",

This is very poor service, based on the reviews I have read your support is speedy and on time, however what I have experienced is not the case.Today is the 4th of December and they gave me an update, however, they did not do a recon on my account they did not check my trades to see if the error is on their metrix system or on my side, they just read me the metrix without giving me a detailed description of why their metrix comes to a certain drawdown but when I do a recon on my trades, I have not breached any rules. I highly believe I got rug pulled, because when I gave them my stats and asked them to do a recon to prove that I am wrong, their support team just started ignoring me proving that these guys are just here to Farm your money, I would recommend anyone to just go to FTMO, they are way more transparent. I believe they give their high networth individuals a good service, but for starters and people who are starting out with funded challenges. I do not recommend this company based on the services I received, if there were an option to show my metrix for reviewing, I would have for the audience to see. As they are not giving me an explanation for my points I brough up to them, all I asked from them is to prove me wrong with a thorough recon or open up my account again.",

      "content": "BEWARE OF THIS SCAM! AVOID IT LIKE A PLAGUE! First of all, I want to address all of the 5 star reviews that this scam website has gotten. If you read through them, you notice that 95% of them are people giving 5 star review based on their chat that they have had with their help desk. But this is not a Information Service it is a Prop firm so all these votes are just invalid. Now let's get to my story of how I got scammed even after passing the 2 phase challenge. I passed the 2 phase challenge and get their \"Congratulations\" email that mentioned now my account is being reviewed. After around 12 hours I get an email that my account has been flagged as HFT and I have failed. They send a screenshot of the 3 trades that I took to test my local trade copier. These trades were only 0.01 lot and were closed instantly with the loss of less than $1. What is HFT? Anyone who know just a bit about trading knows that High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is a method of getting in the market with very large lot size and getting out very quickly in order to get some profit. You tell anyone who even has 1 month experience in trading that someone is doing \"HFT\" using 0.01 lot they'll just laugh at your face. This just shows that the guys behind Funding Traders are complete scammers and just want a reason to steal your money even if the reason is utterly ridiculous and doesn't even make sense. So do yourself a favour and go trade with a prop firm that will value your money and skill and your time. Unlike these clowns. HFT with entering the market with 0.01 lot :)) what a joke!",

After being directed to their discord to get support I waited 72 hours before someone with a childish screen name responded to me. After proving through screen shots that they flagged my account falsely, I was told that there is a delay between the updating between your MT5 account, and the account they use to flag you (Metrix) and that they could not refund me. My actual trading account was at 53k but since their Metrix has a delay in updating, it had my balance at 49k. They flagged my account, and even though I proved that they were wrong with screen shots they made no effort to make it right. Imagine that...you buy an account, you make money, but their system doesn't update and reflect the profit, so they close your account and keep your money. look at their response to my last trust pilot post! They literally admitted that my equity was too high lol! I was winning too much. Wow, just wow these people should be ashamed.",

I lost 180USD from this and got a daily drawdown breach which is another thing the system is a total failure. I have another DE40 order running at a profit around 60USD at the same when the SL got triggered, my daily drawdown breach is just merely 4USD over and obviously the running profit of DE40 could cover this drawdown, but yet the system still flagged my account as breached.Contacted the support via Discord, all of them keep throwing me generic FAQ answer and no one wants to really look into my explanation and conduct an investigation on why the order executed when the price never even reached my SL price. Really fed up with these kind of attitude where they choose which question is more convenient to answer and ignore the facts.Update: So after leaving a 1 star review here, finally a support with some knowledge able to point out my mistake and answer my questions. Bunch of them in discord just know how to throw in generic FAQ answers. So I decided to change to 3 stars due to the lack of knowledge and incompetence of the support team in Discord.",

Helping me solve issues and even paying it back to the customer when delays or things go wrong. I’m impressed with the system and transparency.",

You will have to make your own wild guess that some shit like consistency rule exists in their FAQ. Yet, i didnt breach the 2% consistency rule which mentioned that no trade should exceed 2% of the capital, including any trade opened within 2mins on the same pair as well. The irony is, even if your trade is floating in 0.5% but the value of SL placed is above 2% or above, they will give you a hard breach. Another thing, they only shared a screenshot with me of that days trading history which had multiple trades in it and upon asking to kindly mention the exact positions which breached either of the messed up rules existing hidden within your FAQ section, they simply closed the chat upon me. I have screenshots of the entire conversation, but ALAS ! this website doesnt provide an option for uploading images.",

      "title": "Transparency and Communication Gaps",
      "content": "I started with this prop firm in March 2024 by purchasing a $200K account before they migrated to Tradelocker. Initially, MT5 and CTrader were the available platforms, and I chose MT5. However, shortly after, the firm transitioned to Tradelocker, which had numerous issues at launch. There were many reported errors and significant disruptions (evident in their Discord discussions), including slippage, incorrect lot sizing, and problems with opening or managing trades. One of my trades was affected, resulting in a $46 over-risk error for their 2% Rule. (I trade 1% only) While some clients received compensation for similar issues, I was not reimbursed despite providing evidence, and questioning if they looked at it.Communication over email and Discord felt unresponsive and generic, lacking tailored support for specific issues. As a trader who prioritizes risk management, it was disappointing not to see more personalized responses, especially when evidence was provided.The firm's consistency rule, while understandable, is presented in a way that can be confusing. It’s a nested rule not immediately flagged by the system, potentially causing traders to unknowingly violate it after months of trading. The dashboard does not notify the trader of these issues until a manual review is conducted, which raises questions about its utility.For any prop firm aiming to be the best, it’s crucial to listen to customer feedback and provide clear, simplified rule explanations. The current \"per trade idea\" rule could be clarified further, considering that traders interpret information differently.On a positive note, once Tradelocker stabilized and the firm resolved its initial connectivity and broker issues, the platform operated smoothly. I found some of Tradelocker’s features to be better than MT5, and it’s clear the platform team is receptive to feedback, as updates have been frequent. When the system worked, executing trades was straightforward and reliable.In summary, while the trading experience improved over time, addressing unique issues remains a significant challenge for this firm. Communication often felt automated and lacked a personalized touch. Discord responses were particularly dismissive, and email support frequently referenced prior exchanges rather than taking ownership of errors, putting the onus back on the user. This kind of response creates frustration and diminishes trust, especially when evidence is provided.The firm’s approach to handling rule violations could also be more transparent to help traders avoid confusion. While they offered a discount to retake the challenge, many traders prioritize integrity and proper handling of issues over mere financial incentives.Despite these setbacks, I would consider trying this firm again if they enhance their system's ability to detect violations promptly and make the dashboard more functional rather than focusing solely on aesthetics. Clear, straightforward rule explanations and genuine transparency would go a long way in building trust and improving the overall experience for clients.",

      "content": "Mixed experiences:Everyone who is considering going with this propfirm please be aware of their not so emphasized rules that you can only find if you go and seriously study their terms. It is also hard to understand what they mean exactly.The one in particular I’m talking about if I understood it correctly is that your daily loss of 4/5% is only partially true. What they hide in the details is that if you open a position less then 2 minutes from another position that goes the same direction those positions basically counts as one, so if both positions hit 1% loss now that counts as 2% and once the loss percentage combined goes above 2% you have lost the challenge.This is what they call trade IDEA in their consistency rules.so we can say that the 2% loss per trade again is partially true, very clever with the words used. Be aware they are smart people, and their business model is not to find profitable traders or at least not their first objective for sure with these let’s say complicated rules.Their platform and app is ok, and they have news trading or at least you won’t lose your account if you open a position during news event. Pricing is reasonable compared to other firms but if you decide to go with them study their terms because they are no different than any other firm, as each have a unique rule (trap) that you can fall in.Now I have to go and study FTMO’s rules again because so far I believe they are the only ones that have no shady rules and you can trade as you like. They are on the pricier side but after this experience I think it’s worth paying that extra.",

      "content": "I worked with this company over a year and everything was great. Support was helpful, there was a good community. But something changed. They created a new dashboard system and since than all payouts are taking very long time. And people are complaining.I left company a few moments ago. I quit all their discord channels and i will never go back. Reason for this is, i don't trust them anymore. Allow me to elaborate.They have a %2 percent rule. If a trader loses more than %2 of his/her account in a single trade idea, the account is failed. In a trade, i've risked %1.8 with a stop/loss. And there was no major news event. And i was using their platform called TradeLocker which is unfortunately notorious for bad slippages even non-news event times. And trade went south, i made %1.98 loss but there was also commisions so i thought i think i've failed the account. I opened a ticket and asked if i breached the rule and i told them if i did, i want to know NOW. A guy told me that everything was fine and i could continue trading. And i made 560 USD on that account. I have all the visual proofs for this.Long story short, after making me wait a couple of days they told me i had breached their consistency rule and my account had failed and i wasn't getting paid. They offered me a same size free retake (of the account) but i didn't accept it. Now listen to this:I admit that %1.8 risk for %2 lost limit is a little over. That is on my end. But what is the limit? %1.7? %1.6? Who can %100 say %1.5 is secure? Because, as i said, only proper tool they are offering is TradeLocker and it is notorius for horrible horrible slippage's to ruin your trade event non-news times. So how can anyone feel safe with a tool like this?And worse part is, i can't work with this company anymore because you suddenly learn that an employee from the company says one thing, and you trust him/company and next day another person/department says complete opposite and ruins you. They cancel your account, deny your payout, everything. The day i asked the support (is my account terminated? i want to know now) was 14/11/2024. The date they told me everything was terminated was 24/11/2024. I've waited 10 days! Do you want to work with a company like this? You pro-actively question your status and some person assures you, \"everything is ok. go back to trading\" you give everything to make money for yourself and the company and after 10 days, some other person says that you are failed?And one last thing. Things move so slow there that, once you request a payout and if that's the only account you have, you have to wait until you are cleared. They don't even come up with a simple idea like: \"Ok, you requested a payout. While we examine your trades, here's your account reset back to original balance. Go and trade. And if there is a violation on the previous one, we will talk\" Is it that hard? No, you should patiently wait until somebody clears you. I am sure there are firms that can do that and definetly this will be on my checklist when i choose my next firm.So please beware.---(This is my response to company's reply. Original content is above and is untouched)Hey FT,Yes, your staff's mistake cost me 10 days. That is irreversible lost. You offered me complimentart re-try but i didn't want it because i don't want to experince this again.And as for TradeLocker, everything you say is true. Furthermore, when it comes to risk management and budgeting, that's the best tool available. And i am gonna miss these features. But, i don't know where that liquidty coming from but that liquidty (or lack thereof) is source of all kind of problems. Nobody request you a guarentee when it comes to stop losses but anybody who have used a decent broker with MT4/5 will acknowledge that at normal times these tools/services rarely slips. And yours is unreliable.Have a good day.",

Trade locker uses depth of market in filling orders which makes it accurate to live trading conditions with regards to slippages. Additionally, stop losses are not guaranteed at the exact price you placed, these only stop orders which are filled at the best price possible. The best price possible is dependent on the liquidity and volatility at any moment.",

What's evil is the apparent rule was broken on Oct 24th but i was not disqualified. They continued to let you trade thinking everything is good and when you finally think you passed they comb your account to find errors to fail you. Everyone knows the mental and emotional toll trading takes and when you fail a challenge its gut wrenching. BUT to think you passed and to put all the work in only to fail you when you think you've succeeded is evil on another level. I have screenshots of everything including the conversation if anyone would like to review them yourselves DM me. Also I reported them to my Credit card company as fraud and was instantly re-imbursed for anyone else in the same boat. Apparently credit card companies love going after prop firm companies.

What made this experince wonderful was the live chat. I have only one concern not with the agent but with one of the examples showing what is allowed for the risk; it shows 6% in total but the max daily drawdown is 5%. This could cause someone to lose the account if they don't understand risk management. Well done with the customer service anf half off promotion.",

Here the excess loss has been refunded.- Buying the wrong challenge configuration (1-Step instead of 2-Step). Here the challenge congiguration has been updated within a few minutes.  Many thanks here to KHALIFA, CED & LANCE !The trading rules here are very strict and tight, definately not optimal for every trader. In particular the “Martingale” restrictions, which make the classic DCA and scale-ins impossible (i.e. instead of opening a 5 lot position only open a 1 lot position and scale in during drawdowns). You also have a 2% max loss allowance per Trade.",

I told them I have 300 deals I do not know and do not follow this method but only because I succeeded in the account in only three days and when I demanded my right they blocked their channel on the Discord application whoever goes there sees many complaints and demands and because of this thing a 50% discount was given on account price..I ask everyone to save money and not buy any account and most of the positive comments here are fake and this thing was requested by the support team everyone who talks to them they beg and send him a link to give an excellent rating and mention the name as well.. Please be careful and I have all the proof .. I know a friend who did not send him the profits of 10,000$ only for the same reason that they are lying..",

As a firm principle, we require all our traders to strictly adhere to the established rules to maintain consistency and fairness across all accounts. It is essential for us to uphold the integrity of our trading rules to ensure a level playing field for all traders. In your case, you had multiple trades that only lasted less than 15 seconds, which violates our anti HFT rule, this is why your account has been marked as \"Failed\".",

CEO is experienced in the industry and has great vision in guiding this companymy feedback would have been to improve payout processing times but the company has already done that by implementing that into the new dashboard, which I cannot wait for.Conclusion : Highly recommend this prop firmPs - thanks to Ced, Leo, Rob, David, John, Khalifa & Lance for all of the help!",

      "content": "I really liked Fundingtraders.com approach and i believed in their CEOs words how he is for the traders. The way they handle their TOS is absolutely unhuman!They have this rule if you have a position running and its slightly into profit and you open another bigger lot size your account is terminated. But they wont tell you until the risk management team looks into your account. Meaning you can be wasting your time completing a challenge only to know afterwards your account has violated a rule which no other prop firm has! Both positions together where far away from 2% DD and they were open for only 13 seconds(!!!) before i closed the 2nd one again. So even by mistake if you happen to open another position and its bigger even if its a reasonable size (1 and 2 lot on a 50k on a no news day and my usual size was 4 lot) you are screwed with them.Really sad story I expected more. If you claim you are for the traders then at least give a warning and explain the problem offer a free reset or anything! And first and foremost inform the trader immidiatly! I happened to ask them because someone told me about hidden rules and I found out after digging into every of their TOS.UPDATE - > answer to your answer:You state, I quote 2024-10-16: \"To clarify, we've stated that a trader may only add up to one position on an already losing trade idea. This position may not be of a larger size than the first.You may add as many positions as you want on a winning trade\"I can only add up to a losing trade idea but a line below you say I can add up to a winning position as much as I want???

They failed me as soon as I hit target and I was beyond myself. Contacted customer support and they were useless. Ignoring what I was explaining to them, and telling me that I breached due consistency rule. If I breached it then why didn’t you guys shut the account down straight away ? Why wait until I hit my profit target.? Honestly I feel robbed and I can see why that prop firms are starting to disappear. Ah well karmas a thing hey",

      "content": "Fundingtraders is a prop company that blocks clients' accounts under fictitious pretexts.Before delving into my problem, you need to understand what martingale trading isMartingale trading implies increasing the risk after a losing position, that is, fixing the loss and you must trade in one direction.For example, if you get a stop of 0.25%, the position doubles and the size of the stop-loss will be 0.5%, and so on.For those who doubt, open Google, this is exactly what is written there.Further.I went through an account for $ 10,000, as a test, to understand whether the company really pays, but now I understand that the guys block accounts under any pretext.And here the question is not whether this is a small account or I decided to raise a fuss out of thin air. In general, is there such a precedent to save the funds of other traders who want to undergo a larger test in this prop company, for example 100k accounts.Blocked account number: 822295I'm attaching deals for which, I believe, the account was blocked.The difference between the positions is 0.01 lot, which means that the prop will block your accs by any for any reasons.Was there a martingale in these deals?Definitely - NOIn these positions, I did not exceed the acceptable risk of 2%, per deal or trading idea.In fact, the position size was increased with a total risk not exceeding the stop-loss size of even 1%.I would like to draw attention to the fact that when purchasing an account, we accept the rules, which state the following:- Acceptable risk of 2% per idea- Acceptable drawdown of 5% and 10% per day and the total account size, respectively.Not a word about the fact that it is forbidden to trade using martingale. This is not the first time that a case like mine has happened, I personally know other traders who have encountered a similar problem.Even if they don't return my account, I want to protect other users from cooperating with this prop company.",

However, their claims and reasons were not related to Martingale betting at all.If the rules were indeed violated in Phase 1, why didn’t they notify me at that stage? Instead, they allowed me to pass both Phase 1 and Phase 2 before canceling my account.They did nothing to compensate for my loss and the time I invested in passing the challenges.

Especially Leo, Khalifa and etc...They said you can hold on weekend, but as a trader, you should be warned that spread could occurs during the open Asia session.But, I've seen my account been violated, about consistency rules of reaching the limit of $500. But how this could happen if I had a Stop loss that should've normally be respected ?.But what they're decided, is to say that they won't reinstate my account. What a lack of services, responsibilities !As a good and honest company, they should have given back the account, and warned the traders. Because my stop loss didn't been triggered as it should have. So in this case, wouldn't see the price running over my stop loss settled. So my question is, why stop loss should exist if we can not trust the ssyste to recognize that is there a Stop or take profit?. We are not talking about slippage on trading news event, but stop didn't been respected at the market opening. It's not the responsibility of the trader, but it's on the company to ensure that traders are safe with the company and the system.But they blame me for this and insist that they won't reinstate my account.I want to aware any traders here who want to  trade with thus company that, they don't respect what they saying, and you could see yourself be lose your account based on consistency and hidden rules which are not on your fault. My stop loss has been triggered as it should have, and they refuse to understand and reinstate my account. I have trusted them before, but not anymore after this.I'm very disappointed.",

I hopped on Discord, submitted a ticket, and received a response within a minute from Khalifa. They were extremely professional, well spoke and helpful. They identified the issue which was part of a larger issue with my trading server. I received a message the next day saying everything should be working now. When I went to the dashboard, my phase 2 challenge was ready. Everything taken care of and I only lifted my fingers to write a simple help ticket.I’m very pleased.",

Your phase 2 account also showed an abnormally large number of trade positions in a very short time frame of 1 -2 minutes while being able to switch directions smoothly. Also, there seems to be a uniformity in all trades.This is deemed unrealistic and will have a hard time recreating in normal trading conditions as we have to copy trade from a master account. This method will eat up profit due to latency and fees considering the high lot size used in a short amount of time. Unfortunately, we are uncomfortable proceeding with the funded account especially noting the nature and uniformity of trades used in the challenge phase of the account. Resolution:Due to this, we will not be able to advance this account to the next stage. Your account will receive a full refund on evaluation fees. We also recommend you go through our help center or our TOS to get a better understanding of our platform's rules and objectives.Thanks for your understanding and I hope to hear from you.Best Regards,Risk Management at FundingTradersHow can they denied my account after I spent such a long time trying to pass it, I trade, I did not over leverage I risk 1% to make 2% but they don’t want to give away funded accounts so they give excuses I don’t have a lot of money so this money would of changed my life for ever I work a full time job making 2k a month and a funded account would change everything, and when I finally pass my account they denied my dream, I had to trade in the toilet at work and that’s why the trades where short",

      "title": "Rules setup to make you fail",
      "content": "It seems like props are adding rules in hopes you fail. To clarify, I passed phase 1 and was immediately given my phase 2 challenge. I passed phase 2 and in the review stage it was determined I actually failed phase 1. I didn’t gamble and never risked more than 1% per OPEN trade. This company has rules for “trade ideas”. If you open a trade less than 2 minutes after closing a trade they then count those 2 trades as 1 trade idea ( or 1 trade I guess?). They total the 2 trades together and if you breach 2% with those 2 trades then they fail you. They know most traders risk 1% per trade so they were intentional with setting up that rule.  I spent hundreds on challenges with them and was excited to complete the challenges and felt I did quite well. Well, turns out I opened a losing trade 30 seconds too soon. So because I opened my losing trade 1:35 minutes after closing a trade I am a risky trader lol. If I would have taken the same loss at 2:01 then woohoo you pass! The two losses were 20 minutes apart. Many traders in the chat thought that rule meant you can lose 2% in 2 minutes. Nope, doesn’t matter if the actual losses are hours apart. You just can’t open the trades within 2 minutes of closing another. So that is “risky” to them yet they allow news trading… I wonder why because all other props I’ve traded don’t allow news trading. Oh yeah, because you open up to gamblers who can lose quite fast and easily during news. But be careful. Because they have a clause that states if you rely “too heavily” during news you can fail as well. I saw an instance of this happening in the Discord to someone that made a profit from news. Another reason to fail a profitable trader. Such an arbitrary and useless rule, and just checking the discord you can see how new traders are also going through the same denial because of the 2 minute rule. They won’t fail you after phase 1. I had to waste time doing phase 2 for them to tell me I failed for phase 1.",

I have had a few issues that I needed assistance with that it's as simple as opening a ticket on Discord and someone replies to you more than happy to deal with your issue in a matter of minutes. Other prop firms you have to email or go on the chat bot and it's a nightmare. All I can say is thank you Khalifa for answering my questions quickly and thoroughly. Keep up the good work team. You guys keep impressing me. Cheers!!",

What a flipping joke of a prop firm. It will not show you failed on consistency unless you pass folks and they gave me a massive slip on Bitcoin .. all the trading logs shows the stops i set. Avoid and save yourself the time you will waste. Beware they will leave you to pass before they hit you with a consistency violation of their creation.

Please if you are a beginner, moderate or advance trader do not put your money into this company. All the 1 star reviews are true they are basically a scam and I'm sure they will try to respond to this review and make it seem like I don't know what's going on and that I just lost the account because of consistency rule violation. They are a waste of time you could have violated the rule before you made your 20k when you go to get your money out that when they will tell that you violated the rule. I originally wrote a good review cause there support team would literally beg you to write one and send a screenshot to make sure you did. I can't be bothered to write everything that happened today but this company is disgusting and isn't handled well.

      "content": "Hi everyone,I recently conducted a test on this platform with a starting balance of $10,000, and I would like to share my experience and some advice.Overall, my trades were successful, with only one negative outcome, and I managed to achieve a 10% profit by the second day. However, my risk management system wasn't accepted, even though I only opened one position at a time. I opened a second position only after closing the first one with a profit. It’s essential to remember that the maximum you can risk is 2% of your initial balance per trade. I recommend limiting your risk to 1.5% per trade with a stop-loss of $100 to $150 to help safeguard your profits.It's important to focus on consistency and long-term profitability rather than aiming for large daily gains.This platform offers excellent opportunities for skilled CFA traders, and the customer support is commendable. While it may take some time to receive a response, they address all inquiries (just avoid being too persistent).I would like to extend my gratitude to a great support representative named Magnesium, who assisted me with what I can only assume was Australian enthusiasm. :)Thank you, everyone, and thank you, Magnesium! :)",

Instead, I went with a few other companies, one that scammed me for 4 months straight by changing the rules, denying your payouts, etc with terrible customer service that did not care about you, before just dropping my accounts (thanks NSF), the other firm just disappeared off the planet with 13k of payout waiting for me.  Funding traders so far has been very professional, the customer service guys are extremely helpful, respectful, and want you to succeed - shout out to CED & LANCE & KHALIFA & SAINT.   Such a difference from some of the other firms out there.",

Please read below... and be very careful with this limitation.BAD:On a good way to fulfill the 1st step of a challenge, my account was suspended immediately. NO WARNING - NOTHING! Dow Jones had yesterday a great rebounce after drop down. I went LONG on a quite good level with DJ. Closed and opened again a trade, no doubling. Sometimes SL or TP were catched within less than 1-2 minutes. I wanted to be sure and on the safe side always, looking if we can keep the trend. Therefore I had around 5-6 trades within 10 minutes, some of them were shorter than 2 minutes.Why did FUNDING TRADES suspend my account.I was not allowed - in the same area, which was DJ - to close a TRADE and open the next TRADE earlier than 2 MINUTES. Also it is not allowed to close a trade within 15 SECONDS in general.So I had the 10.000 USD account (challenge) around 24 hours. Payed 100 USD for that, I had within 15 minutes already +7% (700 USD) and was suspended... GOOD THINGEyare, from the Support team of Funding Traders had a lot of patience and explained to me that possible problem in detail via CHAT. As nobody answered since yesterday on my mail, to explain the details about my suspension. EYARE is very kind and nice person. Thank you for taking time for the detailed explanation.Probably FUNDING TRADERS can unlock my account and let me finish the challenge, after the detailed explanation. In the CONSISTENCY RULES it is described unclearly...RegardsAlex",

These days beggars can’t be choosers so I continue to trade here because they are reputable they pay and their trading conditions I think I unbeatable and they have great customer support.",

      "content": "Trade locker under the guise of FundingTraders deletes my trades whenever it deems fit, it also constantly widens the spread when it reaches my orders leaving them untriggered, this week I edited an open trade that was in profit and afterwards it was immediately closed. When my stops are hit it seems losses are always larger than anticipated but this doesn't seem to happen when profits are reached. TradeLocker charts are also designed to game your stops, when you have multiple accounts you'll notice 200 pip stops are reached on their platform before other accounts even get activated, I experiemced this again yesterday so i moved my entry since price was close to it whilst being miles away on my other accounts. Tradelocker responded by saying the firms are the ones who manipulate trades, so I reached out to Funding Traders support with this and they said I must go make a review on their discord with my disgruntlements. Now they think I'm unaware they block negative reviews on discord so at least I have this place to share with the world where they can't control the narrative.I noticed that most reviews are about their fast customer service when people are handing over their money for challenges. Go figure. FTMO and other older firms are still the best with no shenanigans when trading. Giiving these newer firms a chance always proves a waste of resources and it's clear they survive off rookies who can't tell when their trading conditions are rigged. Whether it's them or Tradelocker, I'll never know but one thing is for sure, someone is out to get us.Update: I did some research and learned that firms who rig trading conditions do so by using a Virtual Dealer Plugin. It maximizes unfavorable slippage by further delaying entries and stops. It also cancels positive slippage in the traders favor by either rejecting the order outright or places the trade back at its original requested price negating any positive slippage.As if the markets aren't already tough enough.",

I found Funding Traders and so happy I made the decision to go with them. Not only do they have a great support team like Khalifa and Ebi, but the reliability of their onboarding and payout process makes me feel secure. They do also have excellent add-ons like 100% payout split. I took advantage of that as well as another coupon code and have successfully received my first 100% payout-split payout today. I am excited to grow my account and my trading career with FT. $100k down, many more to go! -Excellent team-Can use EAs-100% payout splits available-bi-weekly payouts-Amazing support teamWIN WIN!CEO and Owner of DFM Capital Inc",

BUT, and there is a big but, the profit you see in a live trades never actually materialises to your P&L. Every single trade i have closed at a (profit) the closing profit has quite significantly changed when it appears in my trade summary. All these moments add up. Sure, they will claim slippage but on every single trade?! I have not seen it before when i have traded live funds to this extreme. The losses also increase when your SL gets hit often more than the set amount which makes risk management tricky. This is my only gripe as i am enjoying trading on Trade Locker and the customer service is good",

This customer support is the best support from a prop firm I’ve ever had! Once again special thank you and shout out to every name i mentioned, you guys are fantastic and thus I believe this truly is a caring prop firm.

      "title": "They are using contradictory phrases in their articles",
      "content": "I bought a $50k account, and after some time I reached around $50,900 in the first stage. Then I went long 3 lots in silver, which initially showed a $400 loss due to unfair spreads. It then went to a $790 loss, at which point I opened another long with 3 lots with a $400 loss at the beginning!!! After 1 minute, they closed my positions and sent an email stating that I was breaching their consistency rules!!!! My two trades had losses of $790 and $405 I called support and asked why this happened to my account? They told me that based on the article, I had breached their rules! It is funny because the article did not mention the 2% loss limit on all similar positions! At the beginning of the article, they mentioned no more than 2% loss per trade, which means I did not breach this rule. But at the end of the article, they used a new invented phrase called \"Trade Idea\". I asked them what they meant by \"trade idea\"? They said a trade idea means a setup!!!!! I was wondering and asked them why they didn't use the term \"Setup\"? Then the representative started explaining to me what they considered a trade idea. So I told them why didn't they include this explanation in the article? Then he told me instead of complaining, I should buy another challenge!!!I wonder he didn’t answer me anymore !! Can you believe it! My recommendation is don't buy from them, as they use contradictory rules to take our money and confuse us. This kind of company and customer service just ruins the entire business.Pat was the guy who supposed to solve the issue with theirs contradictory rules .I am really upset that I experienced such an occasion in my life, more than the money that I lost in just 30 minutes.",

I am especially grateful to the Operations Director RobКristian for his attention and fair solution to the problem with the promotional code due to my fault.Everyone also knows about the very fast migration of Funding Traders when there is a problem with MT4/5 to other platforms.  Compared to other companies, it was prepared and traders were notified in advance.  I fully support their consistency rule of 2% risk per trade and I don’t understand why some traders write negative reviews because of this.  The stock exchange is not a casino, and gambling addiction is a disease.  Funding Traders are right about this.  I look forward to a long cooperation with them...",

Prior to engaging in a challenge i questioned support on the spreads that my most commonly traded pair would see throughout the day, i was given a tradelocker account to login and check the spreads which appeared to be quite competitive, although i trade on MT5. Much to my demise as soon as i had purchased a challenge and examined spreads i noticed they were nearly 3x of what they were on Tradelocker. The broker feed CONSTANTLY froze, in in excess of 4 times every session. This feed was opened in conjuction with other firm feeds to which no issues were prevalent. Competitive prices however all in all this is a VERY poor service, spend the extra money with a clean cut entity.",

      "content": "PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COST!!This prop firm is a waste of time and resources. I paid for the 7-day payout add-on when I purchased my account and have now been denied payout twice. The first time they claimed that I did not trade much on the account which makes no sense after because I traded 2 days out of 5 trading days, traders should be allowed to trade according to their edge and trade plan, but they claimed I did not take enough trades for them to access my performance when they already accessed my trading in the evaluation phase. This was wrong because they advertised 7-day payouts as an add-on. I decided to keep trading the account and made more profits. When I requested a payout the second time, the excuse they gave me was that I traded news and they do not allow traders to \"heavily rely on the news\" although they allow news trading. However, the trades they claim were taken during news were not opened or closed at the time of a news event. USDCAD was closed 3 hours before the news, I was in EURJPY before the news and closed out before the news event. The bottom line is that they would find reasons not to pay you. Please Please Please!! Save your money and time. There are better options out there.",

      "content": "FundingTrader is definitely one of the few reliable prop firms. I started trading with them because they still provided MT5. I could choose a 90% profit split. I took a $100,000 one-step account and was able to get it for around $360 with their running discount, the lowest price in the industry, I know.I had a shocking first day as my two gold limit orders were executed and closed in less than a second, and I was in drawdown. I contacted customer service, and they said it was a system error and put the money back in my account. It had only been a few days since they moved to their new broker, and I was a bit worried at first. But as days went by, my trading experience got much better. I never experienced slippage on market orders and had very clean executions(I trader 5-10 lots GOLD)I finished my evaluation, got my live account, and completed the KYC process the same day. The customer service is really great. The customer chat box is always open like a friend waiting to help you. Special mention to Magnesium; he has been my support from the start, always proficient in sorting out my concerns. I think he is also a trader, so he understands the problems as if they were his own and takes necessary action. He's never in a rush and always provides great support. He talks to you like a friend, always cheering and greeting.Overall, great stuff so far. I haven't requested a payout yet, but following the Discord channel, I see there are no problems with payouts. I will update here on my first payout experience.The only thing I did not like is the 5% drawdown. The rest is fantastic.",

I had to ask for a refund since there were no trades placed on the account and it was earlier than 14 days ( their criteria).Fortunately , the support team ( specially , someone named \" Magnesium\" ) took care of it and I saw maximum cooperation and ease in getting back my money. This is a good sign for their company in general , in an industry that is filled with scammers who just wanna make a quick buck and run away. I will be cetainly have an account here in the future when I am ready!",

I was getting ready for some sort of chat box with someone who only answers during business hours and makes me wait forever as I have experienced in other prop firms, but they worked directly through Discord. I started a ticket and within 30 seconds Ced got on and chatted in real time with me. There was no wait. He was very patient and even when I asked my question again because I wasn't clear about the answer, he answered me very patiently and even rephrased the answer to a way my concern was addressed. I will definitely be buying a challenge from them and I am looking forward to adding that experience to my review as well. With support like Ced, I am confident I will be well taken care of.",

      "content": "I've had a great experience so far with FundingTraders with one issue. I try to be as honest as possible, so outside of this issue things have been perfect. However, the problem was big enough to lose a star.I completed my 10% eval and 5% verification for a $100,000 challenge. However, I wasn't verified for the funded account because it was stated that I broke the 2% total drawdown on one of my trades. I DID NOT have an issue if I broke a rule.The issue was that the infraction was during the 10% evaluation, yet after getting 10% and yet another 5%, none of it counted which is unfortunate. It would have been much better to \"flunk\" the 10% eval than to get 10% and then 5% only to be told that something I did days ago disqualified me.I've been very happy with the service team and there are new developments with their services and offerings which is why I had no problem getting a new evaluation with them. I think they are a top-notch firm, I just wish they would catch an infraction when it happens so that a person doesn't waste time and trades on an evaluation they can't pass. I can't imagine if it took me weeks to get through, but luckily it was just a couple of days.I'm sticking with them as my #1 firm, just be conscious of that 2% rule and they will review your account upon request if you think you have an infraction.",

I passed 2 challenges and failed on the \"consistency rule\" so they gave me another challenge free of charge (200k) after the first breach of this consistency rule they closed my account with any other option although the account balance was 193k. So avoid this prop firm as they are making money from failed traders not from trading using hidden rules in FAQ.On all their advertises you can't see the 2% consistency rule but 5% daily draw down. To be able to find this rule you need to dig in their FAQ rules. As this is very crucial rule this should be visible so every trader can see it in advance not afterword's when is too late. According to be this is a trap! At lease they should offer you a free new challenge if you have failed the 2% consistency rule if they are genuine prop firm and really want to earn from trading but not from failed traders so here we are they want to get you in their trap and than take your money due to this 2% consistency rule.",

      "content": "I bit lengthy but this was my experience. I went with them because they accept U.S. clients and seemed to have the most favorable conditions.Took me 3.5 weeks to pass both phases. After I passed phase 1 on MT5 they swapped me to Tradelocker for phase 2. Not sure why but there seems to be some kind of back end issue with companies for US clients using MT4/5. Seems to be this way with any firm and U.S. clients. Regardless, I hated Tradelocker initially but then in time got used to it and now I'm fine with it. But I passed and they funded me.  (Note: be aware of the 2% rule. You can't lose more then 2% on any trade/ trade idea or you fail. I hated this at first but in time started to like it as it just lowers the risk/stress on my trades.)On my funded account on day 1 I took a heavy loss , I was tired from my other job and just messed up, spent the rest of the week clawing back to finish the week at +700. I cashed out and they paid me in 24hrs. I followed the rules, passed the test, got funded, was profitable eventually, and got paid. Customer support was there to help when I needed it. So they got 5 stars from me.  For U.S. clients looking for a new place this is worth checking out.",

      "content": "I decided to tell my sad story about the payment on FT.In short, they screwed me over.It all started when I requested a withdrawal from them and they responded to me within 4 days. Then they gave up and said that everything is ok with the trades, we are ready to pay you, but only on Rise. Rise is not available in the Russian Federation and probably, as it seems to me, there was already an expectation here to weed me out. I registered Rice with my friend, and we waited for the approval of the docks for 4 days, today is the 5th and they still haven’t responded to us via verification.Another friend came to the rescue and we thought about withdrawing through his rice. Yesterday I sent it to them and then the most interesting thing began. They disappeared again, it is worth noting that they generally responded with an interval of 20 hours on average. Today Rob came back to me and said that supposedly we checked your accounts and discovered copy trading, since you traded the same pairs in the same sessions, provided that the entry price and Opening Time differ by more than 2 minutes in transactions, which in general according to them the same rules is an excellent trading idea. In general, as a result, I received an account block and a refusal to withdraw.The most interesting thing is that as I communicated with Rob, I told him, let’s make the final decision, so that I can go to their discord chat and to the chats of other traders that I am a member of, but they kicked me from the server and banned me. This is the story guys.",

      "content": "As far as prop firms go, its not a bad one. In house technology, they copy profitable traders (apparently) so they should be having enough capital in the back to pay out their funded traders. Website layout isnt bad. But if you fail a challenge, with an open position, you will get spammed with margin call emails. Multiple a day, from FundingTraders and the broker/application (cTrader in my case). There is nothing you can do, and support doesnt reply to you. Also, i highly recommend not using their MT5 platform. They dont have their MT5 platform available for PC. i could not find a download link, nor was i sent one. They use Acqua Markets as their broker. Horrible execution times, massive spreads, and bad server connection all led me to failing my challenge. e.g. While i was on mobile, on a chart, i clicked either buy or sell. Nothing showed up on the chart. Clicked it a couple more times, still nothing. Waited a minute or 2 in case it was my internet on my end, tried opening another. Still nothing showed on the chart. Then i went onto my open positions, and i had about 7 positions open due to the poor quality of the broker. Happened to me twice. fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. So i will not be fooled again and i will not be using fundingtraders againThey can say \"its our broker, its not us\", but they chose to go with the broker. Edit: Unsubscribed from fundingtraders/cTrader alerts, and im still getting email alerts about margin from an account that i can not use as the access is disabled. Will not be revisiting.",

Initially, the firm seemed really good, platform and dashboard works really well. Good prices but manually closed my trade before price reversed in price and went towards the favoured position. (have screenshots and live trading data that proves this) They still seem a decent firm just poor support from people who don't seem to care really when Prop Firms have quite a bad name.

However I had more than 2% risk on 10k account but they never said anything. What a dual standards!! Also the policy is hidden in FAQs and not clear to traders and hence used for trap! Later they offered a refund so basically waste of time and money it was! Never going back to them. Excellent experience turned into a nightmare. Be careful!!!",

      "content": "Very recently I bought a $25k evaluation passed in 2-3 days. Phase 2 passed but too quickly apparently and was told I had initially passed then Risk Management decided I had passed “ too quickly”. Exceeding a rule violation with screen prints showing a part of the trade but no equity for context.Told I could re do the evaluation or have refund but both to start phases! Not just the one had failed, although I passed. Seems very like a scam at that point. This evaluation of risk lacked any context of an up-trending market. Pror to this poor treatment I was a very loyal customer but it is one way and this consistency rule could leave you with nothing as it is extremely vague. But a really good run if successive trades will appear to make money then your account will be deemed to have violated and closed.",

      "content": "I have been taking my time on this funded challenge, and everything was going okay. Then the first thing that happened out of the blue was that I was switched from Blueberry Markets, to CBT-Limited MT5 platform, just like that. Fine. Then yesterday, I place any early a.m. trade...no problem. Then I open up Tradingview for the Asia session, and no CBT- Limited even listed, other than my old credentials showing up, And the only broker choice available was a TradeLocker account. Look up their reviews for yourself. They ARE HORRIBLE! 2.3 out of 5 stars. Sign me up! And the customer service rep, named Magnesium\" just keeps lying and stringing you along. First it would be 12-24 hours and it would be resolved. 28 hours late, I inquire. \" Oh, I'm so sorry. I've answered so many questioned today. yours just scrolled up and I forgot.\" \"Here are your credentials. If you have anymore issues, don't hesitate to contact me. Three hours later, after I have let \"Magnesium\" know that I still can't access the platform (36 hours now, not 12-24), all I hear is crickets. I have screen shots of all this. DO NOT TRUST THESE SCAMMERS! YOU WILL LOSE YOUR $!!! By the way, I had the 50k account up to $53,618.12, so more than half way through phase 1. Update: 4/11/2024Well... it seems that I've talked sh** prematurely. Whoever Magnesium is really did get it worked out. Turns out that they really were inundated with complaints and concerns from people having, most likely, the exact same experience that I was having. Thank you FundingTraders, and especially to whoever Magnesium is. I made a rush to judgement. I have recently lost a lot of money due to prop firms suddenly closing. I am sure that I am not the only one, but I do apologize for my impatience. I have amended my 1 star rating to 5 stars. I am still not sure about TradeLocker. FundingTraders trust them, so I will give them a try.",

I have also provided them with screenshots of the winning trades with proper duration and stop losses placed etc., and asked how they consider those a \"shot scalp\"...

I didn't risk either of the phases by trying to pass in 1 day (as you authorized per your rules by the way) and my r/r for 1st phase is 2.8 and 2nd 1.9 r/r (average or higher within the traders industry). The \"risky\" losing trades lasted on average  20 min (I close my losers in time), and winners on average from 2 hours up to 16 hours which is considered no scalping but normal day/swing trading. Also, I passed the challenge not in 1 day but in 50 trades over multiple weeks with only a 2% overall max drawdown and the 2nd phase with a 1% drawdown with all my positions secured by s/l, how is that a high risk? I trade SMC with bank levels with high reliability on volume and divergence. If you don't like the lot size I used then why do you offer a 1:100 margin on forex?  I only agree with the full 500k account as I paid for and spent my time working for in accordance with with your rules.  I am funded by other firms and 200k is a waste of time for me in the matter of time spent to reward gained ratio. Otherwise, I require a full refund because that would be a risk for me to stay with a company violating its own rules.Respectfully, Mikhail On Sun, Mar 31, 2024, 21:17 FundingTraders Help  wrote:Hey Mikhail,Congratulations on passing the $500,000 account challenge.Upon further review of your account, we noticed that the account strategy used for trading relies heavily on aggressive short scalps. This method is deemed unrealistic and will have a difficult time recreating in normal market conditions.  We need to monitor your progress further on a live account and require more data on your trades. We are not comfortable giving you a $500,000 funded account due to the aggressive nature of your trading while using over-leveraged position sizing, considering this is your first account.Moving forward, we are offering to downscale your account to a $200,000-funded account. This resolution helps us manage our risk based on our performance assessment while, on your end, also being able to start making money on your funded account. The difference will be refunded back to your payment method used. Thanks for your understanding and I hope to hear from you.Best Regards,Risk Management at FundingTraders\"",

Large spreads on Nasdaq and Sp5002. The price of Nasdaq and sp500 differs by about 0.5%3. The 2% rule, but if you break it, they don’t delete your account or even notify you.4.

      "content": "I am a professional trader funded with multiple prop firms managing over 2m in funding and after looking to add another one to my list, I picked FT as my next target because of the great reviews and promo code \"MATCH\" that gives a free account of the same size upon reaching payout.I purchased a 300k 1-Step Challenge in order to get a total of 600k in funding with the promo and passed it with a total of 2100 pips in profit, 19 trades with an average R/R of 4.8 which in trading would be considered as amazing stats.It took me only 8 trading days** or just about 2 weeks to make the 10% profit target and had a maximum drawdown of 2.10% which again, would be considered as great trading stats. FT has a 14 days minimum trading rule so I finished the 6 remaining days by taking micro trades to not risk bringing the account below the 10% profit target.Upon verification of my successful challenge, I received an email from Rio of the risk team mentioning they would DOWNSCALE my account to 200k because of the micro trades I took during those 6 remaining days. They also mentioned I had not used a Stop Loss on some of my trades which as per their FAQ is NOT mandatory anyway! This is an absolute RED FLAG and a doubtful, deceiving unprofessional practice for this industry.There are no rules in the FAQ about micro trades being an issue. Also, I have done the same thing with multiple prop firms in the past and without any issues. Furthermore, my trading stats and quality trades clearly prove I was not gambling. Bottom line is, I passed the challenge 100% within the guidelines and FAQ of the company and should be provided with the 300k funded account I purchased. The automatic downscale should be regarded as a red flag by any experienced traders out there. Even after disputing their decision and talking with the team, they denied giving my full 300k funded account. That being said, I will trade the 200k provided to me for now and we'll see if they also provide me with a free 300k account as promised with their \"MATCH\" promotion.For reference, here is a Copy/Paste of the email that was sent to me by FundingTraders.“ Hey Sam,Congratulations on passing the $300,000 account challenge.Upon further review of your account, we noticed that the trading objectives was completed in 8 days, and after that micro-lots were used to pass the minimum trading days of 14 days for a $300,000 account.Combined with this, some trades have no stop loss. This is regarded as a moderate risk in our platform. Moving forward, we are offering to downscale your account to a $ 200,000-funded account. This resolution helps us manage our risk based on our performance assessment and gathering more data on your trader, while, on your end, also being able to start making money on your funded account. The difference will be refunded back to your payment method used. Thanks for your understanding and I hope to hear from you.Best Regards,Rio Admin Head at FundingTraders”",

I also contacted the customer support from discord and the simply just blame on me and did not do anything about it. Also the customer service was pretty bad. The person always trying to avoid my questions and problem and only blaming me. Also the customer service was awful. The person is not polite and also talk rudely as well. Then in the end they didn’t do anything which really makes me mad and I made $800 profit for nothing. This website clearly is a scam.",

I feel like I really got lucky here considering the feedback from so many prop firms. I even compared the spreads to FTMO directly against FundingTraders and at the time it was 3 times bigger on FTMO lol. so yeh these guys are good. just READ THE RULES! (like anything in life)",

      "title": "Better than last month",
      "content": "This is my first payout along with a challenge refund after losing many challenges and funded accounts in other firms, so let me give you a detailed review of the firm.1. 100% split and 7-day payouts - Kudos to their team for introducing this as I don't see it anywhere else. I was thinking how is it possible? But seems like they would earn from us too if we are a good and consistent trader. Win-win for both of us.Most of the other firms only have bi-weekly and monthly payouts. I can't wait that long, personally. So I opted for a 7-day payout and is worth it. Not slow, not the fastest but looks perfect.2. Consistency ruleThere is a 2% trade idea rule which is one of a kind. Some people are calling it a strategy to stop people from making money but trust me if you are a trader, you can easily NOT break this rule. It is not that easy to manage a big firm without a rule like this, they care about their money as well as the trader's consistency. It's not that they take your challenge money after the rule failure, but provide a refund or a retake which itself tells why the rule is here in the first place. This rule has also improved my trading style, slowly getting away from gambling trades.Edit: Unfortunately, they removed the refunds option.3. DashboardThe dashboard is clean and simple which is comfortable to use but there is room for improvement as some details were missing. For example, an order receipt could have been there.4. Spreads and commissionsIf you are an intraday trader, the brokers (currently using - CBT) they use would provide you with a good environment to trade. For example, the spreads for indices are low and there are no commissions on indices even for funded phases. Swap rates are higher which is why I don't hold trades here but seems like this is the case with many brokers as well. I have not used Blueberry but I have heard of some good reviews around the Forex world. Check - ForexPeaceArmy.5. SupportI like the way the support is handled using Discord. I usually get all the answers within 5 minutes of opening a ticket. Some important tickets like Account Review and payouts can take up to 24 hours. You just have to use #submit-ticket on their Discord server instead of using General Chat which some people think is support and complain about no one responding there :DI will update you more on my journey with them as they keep on improving.Edit: 18-04-2024Right now, it is not looking good for the firm. Reasons being - 1. Tradelocker integrationIt is a good platform and I like their roadmap but it seems like the platform was integrated early as there were so many issues.2. New MT5 BrokerThe new MT5 broker is not popular, their homepage doesn't look trustworthy either.3. AdvertisementI wish they concentrate more on their platforms instead of marketing. A good user experience will automatically bring in new traders. Some of the advertisements looked like bait.4. Payout delaysThere were some payouts delayed for a week. It's not a good sign.But I hope they bounce back soon.Update - 18-05-2024cTrader integration -I am glad they introduced cTrader. I am now copying from MT4 to cTrader without any hassle. The trading conditions there are great too. I am not working with their other platforms, so I can't review based on them.Metrix update -The new metrix looks better than the previous one as you can track the consistency rule but the rest of the dashboard needs updates, I hope they are working on it too.",

      "reply_content": "Hey Chinthaka, This rule is not \"hidden\" as you claim. This is called our consistency rule which is shown on the main website and our help center under \"important trading rules\". The goal for this rule is to make sure no traders are risking more than half of their daily drawdown in one single trade idea. Why? To push users trying to gamify the evaluation model by purchasing many accounts and taking 5-9% risk per trade just to get one to pass. Also, this gives us enough data from the user showing consistency in their performance. Instead of having a user pass the evaluation with 1-2 trades risking 5-8%. However, we understand that we will continue to work on making sure all objectives and rules are understood by the user before starting the challenge.",

The principle behind this rule is to make sure that traders are not risking more than half of their daily drawdown allowing them to showcase their edge and risk management skills throughout the evaluation. Its secondary purpose is to prevent users from gamifying the evaluation model. This rule was clearly violated and all the documentations were sent to your email. Options to retake the evaluation or a full refund was given since trading objectives were completed (but trading rules were violated). This rule is clearly stated on our website, FAQ/Help Center, TOS agreed upon purchasing the evaluation, and throughout our community servers/groups. A full refund of the evaluation fees has been sent since the option to retake the evaluation was not chosen. Wishing you the best in your journey!",

The consistency rule states that a user must nor risk more than 2% per trade idea. The principle behind this rule is to encourage users to display their edge and risk management skills. It is also to prevent users from gamifying the evaluation model. Nonetheless, we wish you the best in your prop journey!",

Yes, some processes are still manual, but I got my payout in less than 3 hours of requesting. I am excited because I received this account from a giveaway and here I am withdrawing without any issues. If they did badly I wouldn't have hesitated to call them out, but they fulfilled their end of the bargain. I hope this firm goes higher, I am rooting!",

This would have made my error clear directly after purchasing.Overall, their online platform is not very userfriendly and seems like it has been created with minimal thought to user experience.There is potential in this firm but they are still quite far away from the established players like FTMO.",

The reason for giving another 5 stars is because there is a very special account review service you can use while you're progressing in the evaluation phase. You can get a review of your evaluation account in which you're making a profit. That way if you have violated any rules or there is a problem In your strategy you will find out and rectify before failing. This is something very awsome because after reaching the profit target getting denied a funded account or payout because of violation of any rules is very frustrating for a trader.  This is very trader friendly keep it up guys. Thank you funding traders for all the opportunities and the very support. I definitely recommend..",

They stated that this is a “turbulent risk behavior” consistent with gambling. I used a consistent lot size throughout both phases. They should not claim to allow a max 5% daily loss if they in fact do not.They did end up refunding me which of course means they admitted that I didn’t violate any trading rules.I would like to point out that according to their Discord there are only 21 funded members in the whole firm.
